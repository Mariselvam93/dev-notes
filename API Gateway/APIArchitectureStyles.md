# API Architecture Styles

## 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication. It emphasizes stateless interactions and is resource-oriented, where resources are identified by URIs.

**Use Cases**: Web services, mobile applications, and CRUD operations.

## 2. GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides a single endpoint for fetching data and allows for more dynamic interactions.

**Use Cases**: Complex applications needing flexible data retrieval, such as social media platforms and dashboards.

## 3. WebSockets
WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. They enable real-time communication between the client and server.

**Use Cases**: Real-time applications like chat apps, online gaming, and collaborative tools.

## 4. Webhooks
Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events in a web application. When an event occurs, a request is sent to a predefined URL.

**Use Cases**: Integrating different systems, notifications, and event-driven architectures.

## 5. gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls)
gRPC is an open-source RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers as the interface description language. It allows for efficient communication between services.

**Use Cases**: Microservices architecture, high-performance applications, and inter-service communication.

## 6. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency networks, often used in IoT applications. It uses a publish/subscribe model.

**Use Cases**: IoT devices, remote monitoring, and real-time analytics."""
