**IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS** are three cloud computing service models, each offering different levels of control, flexibility, and management. Here’s a breakdown:

### **1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- **Definition**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for IT admins and developers who need full control over infrastructure.
- **Examples**:
  - AWS EC2
  - Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
  - Google Compute Engine

**Pros**:
✔️ Full control over infrastructure  
✔️ Scalable and flexible  
✔️ Pay-as-you-go pricing  

**Cons**:
❌ Requires technical expertise  
❌ More responsibility for maintenance  

---

### **2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- **Definition**: Provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for developers who want to focus on coding without worrying about infrastructure.
- **Examples**:
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Azure App Services
  - Google App Engine

**Pros**:
✔️ Simplifies development and deployment  
✔️ Handles infrastructure automatically  
✔️ Faster time to market  

**Cons**:
❌ Limited customization  
❌ Dependency on the provider  

---

### **3. SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- **Definition**: Delivers fully functional software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installation or maintenance.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for end-users who need ready-to-use software.
- **Examples**:
  - Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs)
  - Microsoft Office 365
  - Dropbox
  - Salesforce

**Pros**:
✔️ No installation or maintenance required  
✔️ Accessible from anywhere  
✔️ Cost-effective  

**Cons**:
❌ Limited control over features and customization  
❌ Data security concerns

| Feature  | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|----------|------|------|------|
| **Control** | High (Full control over infrastructure) | Medium (Limited to development and app deployment) | Low (Only software usage) |
| **Management Responsibility** | User manages OS, runtime, middleware | Provider manages infrastructure, user manages applications | Provider manages everything |
| **Scalability** | High | High | Limited by provider |
| **Target Users** | IT Administrators, DevOps | Developers | End-users |
