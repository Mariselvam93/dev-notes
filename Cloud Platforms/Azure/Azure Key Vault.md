Azure Key Vault is a cloud service used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as secrets, encryption keys, and certificates. It helps to enhance security by providing access control, auditing, and integration with Azure services.

### Key Features:
1. **Secrets Management** – Securely store API keys, connection strings, passwords, and other secrets.
2. **Key Management** – Manage cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption.
3. **Certificate Management** – Securely manage SSL/TLS certificates.
4. **Access Control** – Uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
5. **Auditing and Monitoring** – Logs all activities for compliance and security monitoring.
6. **Integration with Azure Services** – Works with Azure Functions, App Services, Kubernetes, and more.

### Accessing Azure Key Vault:
You can interact with Azure Key Vault using:
- **Azure SDK for .NET**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure Portal**
- **REST API**

### Example: Accessing Secrets in .NET 8
#### 1. Install the required NuGet package:
```sh
dotnet add package Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

#### 2. Fetch a Secret from Key Vault:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        string keyVaultUrl = "https://your-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net/";
        var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(keyVaultUrl), new DefaultAzureCredential());

        KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("MySecretName");
        Console.WriteLine($"Secret Value: {secret.Value}");
    }
}
```
This example uses **DefaultAzureCredential**, which supports authentication via:
- Managed Identity (recommended in Azure)
- Azure CLI login (for local development)
- Environment variables
