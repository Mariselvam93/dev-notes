## ✅ **1. What is Amazon VPC?**

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, Lambda) in a **custom-defined virtual network**. You have **complete control** over IP address ranges, subnet configuration, route tables, internet access, and security.

## ✅ **2. VPC Architecture and Key Components**

### **a. Subnets**

* A subnet is a segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place resources.
* **Types**:

  * **Public Subnet**: Has a route to the Internet Gateway.
  * **Private Subnet**: No direct route to the Internet; used for backend services.
* **Best practice**: Use multiple subnets across **Availability Zones (AZs)** for high availability.

### **b. Route Tables**

* Contains rules (routes) that determine where traffic is directed.
* Each subnet is associated with one route table.
* Routes can target:

  * Internet Gateway
  * NAT Gateway
  * VPC Peering
  * Transit Gateway
  * VPC Endpoints

### **c. Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* A horizontally scaled, redundant gateway that allows communication between the VPC and the internet.
* Must be **explicitly attached to a VPC**.
* Public subnets need a route to the IGW and public IPs to access the internet.

### **d. NAT Gateway**

* Allows outbound internet access for **private subnets**, but blocks inbound connections initiated from the internet.
* **Managed service** (highly available in a single AZ by default).
* **Elastic IP required**.

### **e. VPC Peering**

* A **direct network connection** between two VPCs using private IPs.
* Can span regions (**inter-region peering**).
* **No transitive routing**: Peering must be explicitly configured between each pair.

### **f. VPC Endpoints**

* Allows **private connectivity** to AWS services without going through the internet.
* **Types**:

  * **Interface Endpoint**: ENI-based (Elastic Network Interface), used for most AWS services.
  * **Gateway Endpoint**: Supports S3 and DynamoDB, route table-based.

## ✅ **3. IP Addressing: CIDR Blocks**

* Each VPC must have an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
* Optional: assign IPv6 block.
* CIDR blocks define the IP address range for the VPC and subnets.
* **5 IPs in each subnet are reserved** by AWS.

### **CIDR Block Expansion**

* You can add secondary CIDR blocks to a VPC to accommodate more IPs.

---

## ✅ **4. VPC Security**

### **a. Security Groups (SGs)**

* **Instance-level virtual firewalls**.
* **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed.
* **Allow rules only**: Cannot explicitly deny traffic.
* Applied to ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces).

### **b. Network ACLs (NACLs)**

* **Subnet-level firewalls**.
* **Stateless**: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed.
* **Allow and deny rules** supported.
* Rule evaluation is done in **number order**.

---

## ✅ **5. Network Access Control**

* Control traffic at both the **subnet** (NACL) and **instance** (SG) levels.
* You can monitor changes using **AWS Config** and **CloudTrail**.

---

## ✅ **6. VPC Flow Logs**

* Captures **IP traffic metadata** going to and from network interfaces.
* Can be sent to **CloudWatch Logs or S3**.
* Use cases:

  * Troubleshooting
  * Performance monitoring
  * Security auditing

---

## ✅ **7. Pricing Considerations**

* **Free**:

  * VPC creation
  * Subnets, route tables, NACLs, security groups
* **Paid**:

  * NAT Gateway (per hour + per GB)
  * VPC Traffic Mirroring
  * Interface Endpoints (per ENI/hour + data)
  * Traffic via Transit Gateway, VPC Peering (data transfer fees)

| Feature                   | VPC Peering             | Transit Gateway       | AWS PrivateLink            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Use Case**              | Small-scale, VPC-to-VPC | Large-scale multi-VPC | Private access to AWS/PaaS |
| **Transitive Routing**    | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                       |
| **Scalability**           | Limited                 | Highly scalable       | Scalable per interface     |
| **Cross-region**          | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                      |
| **Private Access to AWS** | ❌                       | ❌                     | ✅ Yes                      |

## ✅ **9. Best Practices**

* Use **multi-AZ subnets** for high availability.
* Use **NAT Gateway in each AZ** for redundancy.
* Tag all VPC resources for clarity and automation.
* Enforce **least privilege** with SGs and NACLs.
* Use **VPC Flow Logs** for auditing and troubleshooting.
* Separate public and private subnets.

## ✅ **10. Real-world Use Cases**

| Scenario                     | VPC Usage                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Hosting a web application    | Public subnet for web servers, private subnet for DBs |
| Hybrid cloud with on-prem    | Use VPN or Direct Connect with VPC                    |
| Secure access to S3 from EC2 | Use VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3                       |
| Centralized networking hub   | Use AWS Transit Gateway                               |
| SaaS multi-tenant isolation  | Separate VPCs connected via PrivateLink               |

## ✅ **11. Troubleshooting Techniques**

* **No internet access**:

  * Check route table for IGW/NAT GW.
  * Ensure subnet has public IPs.
  * Check SG and NACL rules.

* **Connectivity between VPCs fails**:

  * Check peering is accepted and routed correctly.
  * No transitive routing — ensure direct peering exists.

* **Services unreachable**:

  * Check if using a VPC endpoint or misconfigured DNS.
  * Ensure endpoint is in correct subnet and SG.

* **VPC Flow Logs not capturing traffic**:

  * Ensure it's enabled on correct ENI or subnet.
  * Check IAM permissions and delivery destination.
