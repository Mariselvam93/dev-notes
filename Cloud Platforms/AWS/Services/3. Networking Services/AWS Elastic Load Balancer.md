## üß© What is AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?

**AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets ‚Äì such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses ‚Äì in one or more Availability Zones (AZs). It improves fault tolerance, scalability, and availability.

## üî¢ Types of ELB

### 1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

* **Layer**: 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
* **Routing**: Based on URL path, host, headers, query strings.
* **Use Cases**: Microservices, container-based architectures (e.g., ECS), web apps.
* **Features**:

  * Path-based and host-based routing
  * Native WebSocket support
  * Redirects and fixed responses
  * Target groups by service
  * Integration with AWS WAF

---

### 2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

* **Layer**: 4 (TCP/UDP)
* **Routing**: Based on IP protocol data.
* **Use Cases**: High-performance and low-latency apps, real-time games, financial applications.
* **Features**:

  * Handles millions of requests/sec
  * Static IP support or Elastic IP
  * TLS termination
  * Preserves client IP
  * PrivateLink support

---

### 3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**

* **Layer**: 3/4 (IP packet-level)
* **Purpose**: Deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection).
* **Use Cases**: Network inspection, security appliance chaining.
* **Features**:

  * Transparent traffic redirection
  * Combines transparent gateway + load balancer
  * Integrates with VPC endpoint service

---

### 4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** (Legacy)

* **Layer**: 4 and partial Layer 7
* **Use Cases**: Older apps not designed with ALB/NLB in mind
* **Limitations**:

  * Lacks advanced routing (no path-based)
  * Single target group
  * Deprecated for new designs

---

## üèóÔ∏è ELB Architecture

* **Listeners**: Define protocol/port the load balancer listens on (e.g., HTTP:80).
* **Target Groups**: Contain registered targets (EC2s, IPs, Lambda).
* **Health Checks**: Ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.
* **Availability Zones**: Distributes traffic across multiple AZs.
* **Security**: Integrated with **Security Groups**, **ACM**, and **IAM**.

## üß™ Health Checks

* **Purpose**: Verify application health before routing traffic.
* **Configuration**:

  * **Protocol**: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
  * **Path**: For ALB (e.g., `/health`)
  * **Port**: Can use traffic port or a specific one
* **Thresholds**:

  * **Healthy Threshold**: # of successes before marking as healthy
  * **Unhealthy Threshold**: # of failures before marking as unhealthy

---

## üéØ Target Groups

* Define how load balancer routes traffic.
* Types of targets:

  * EC2 instances
  * IP addresses
  * Lambda functions (ALB only)
* Can associate one or more target groups with a load balancer listener.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Listener Rules

* **Condition + Action** pattern
* Common rules:

  * Path = `/api/*` ‚Üí Target Group A
  * Host = `admin.example.com` ‚Üí Target Group B
* Supported actions:

  * Forward to target group
  * Redirect
  * Return fixed response

---

## üîê Security

* Integrated with **Security Groups** (ALB/CLB)
* **ACM** for SSL/TLS certificates
* Supports **IAM roles** and **policies**
* Works with **AWS WAF** (for ALB)
* Enables **access logs** to S3 for audit

---

## üìà Integration with Auto Scaling

* ELB automatically registers/deregisters EC2 instances launched/terminated by Auto Scaling groups.
* Ensures only healthy, available instances serve traffic.
* Use **Lifecycle Hooks** for graceful connection draining.

---

## üí∞ Pricing

* **Based on**:

  * Number of Load Balancer hours
  * GBs of data processed
* **ALB/NLB/GWLB** have different pricing models:

  * **ALB**: Charged per LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Unit)
  * **NLB**: Charged per processed GB and used hours
  * **GWLB**: Charged for GWLB hours and data processed

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Use ALB** for web apps, microservices, and path-based routing.
2. **Use NLB** for ultra-low latency or TCP/UDP workloads.
3. **Use GWLB** to chain security appliances transparently.
4. Enable **access logs** for auditing and analytics.
5. Configure **connection draining** for smooth de-registration.
6. Use **Auto Scaling** with health checks for fault tolerance.
7. For HTTPS, **use ACM** with auto-renewing SSL certificates.
8. Enable **cross-zone load balancing** for optimal AZ usage (free for ALB, paid for NLB).
9. **Tag** resources for better cost tracking and organization.

## üåç Real-World Use Cases

* **ALB**:

  * Load balancing a containerized app (ECS, EKS)
  * Host-based routing for multi-tenant SaaS
* **NLB**:

  * Financial trading platform needing ultra-low latency
  * Proxying traffic to on-prem via VPN/direct connect
* **GWLB**:

  * Deploying Palo Alto/Checkpoint firewalls as VMs
* **CLB**:

  * Legacy monolithic app using HTTP/HTTPS and TCP

---

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

* For NLB:

  * Use **Elastic IPs** for predictable DNS resolution.
  * Enable **Preserve client IP** for analytics.
* For ALB:

  * Use **HTTP/2** and **WebSocket** for improved performance.
  * Use **path-based rules** to minimize over-routing.
* Enable **Connection reuse** to reduce latency.
* Use **CloudWatch metrics** (e.g., `TargetResponseTime`) to monitor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Techniques

| Issue                        | Cause                                      | Resolution                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 504 Gateway Timeout          | Target took too long to respond            | Check app latency, increase idle timeout      |
| 502 Bad Gateway              | Target returned invalid response           | Check app logs, ensure proper response        |
| Target marked unhealthy      | Failing health checks                      | Check health check path, port, and response   |
| No targets receiving traffic | Wrong listener rules or no healthy targets | Review listener rules and health status       |
| SSL certificate errors       | Expired or misconfigured certificate       | Use ACM for auto-renewal, validate cert chain |
| Latency spikes               | Overloaded instances or AZ imbalance       | Enable autoscaling, cross-zone balancing      |
