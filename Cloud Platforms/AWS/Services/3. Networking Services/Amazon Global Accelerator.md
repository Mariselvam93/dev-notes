## üîπ What is Amazon Global Accelerator?

**Amazon Global Accelerator (AGA)** is a **network layer service** that improves the **availability and performance** of your applications with users across the globe. It routes traffic through the **AWS global network infrastructure**, bypassing the public internet for most of its path.

---

## üîπ Architecture Overview

### Key Components:

1. **Static IP Addresses**

   * Global Accelerator assigns two **static anycast IP addresses** to your application.
   * These IPs serve as a **fixed entry point** to your application endpoints, improving flexibility and consistency.

2. **Anycast Network**

   * Traffic is routed to the nearest AWS edge location using **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.
   * AWS's **private global network** is used for optimized routing.

3. **Accelerator**

   * The top-level resource. Tied to the static IPs and configured with listeners and endpoint groups.

4. **Listeners**

   * Accept incoming traffic on specified ports (e.g., TCP/UDP).
   * Forward traffic to associated **endpoint groups**.

5. **Endpoint Groups**

   * Mapped to **AWS Regions**.
   * Contain one or more **endpoints** (ALB, NLB, EC2).
   * Use health checks to determine traffic flow.

6. **Endpoints**

   * Actual compute resources that receive user traffic.
   * Can be:

     * **Elastic IPs**
     * **Network Load Balancers (NLBs)**
     * **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)**
     * **EC2 instances**

| Feature                          | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static IPs**                   | Consistent IPs that don‚Äôt change, ideal for firewall whitelisting and DNS management. |
| **Global Anycast**               | Routes traffic to the optimal edge location based on client proximity.                |
| **Traffic Distribution**         | Traffic can be weighted across endpoint groups.                                       |
| **Health Checks**                | Continuous checks on endpoints to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy targets.   |
| **Failover & High Availability** | Automatically removes unhealthy endpoints and reroutes to the next best region.       |
| **DDoS Protection**              | Integrated with AWS Shield.                                                           |

## üîπ Use Cases

* **Low-latency global applications** (e.g., gaming, finance).
* **Multi-region, high-availability APIs**.
* **Live streaming and media delivery**.
* **Global mobile applications**.
* **Applications requiring static IPs**.

---

## üîπ Performance and Availability Improvements

* **Latency reduction** by routing traffic through the AWS global network, not the congested public internet.
* **Improved availability** by automatically failing over to healthy endpoints in other regions.
* **Faster DNS resolution avoidance** ‚Äì AGA uses static IPs, not DNS routing.

---

## üîπ Static IP Addresses

* Assigned at the creation of the accelerator.
* Can be **associated with Elastic IPs** if needed (BYOIP support).
* Never change, even if backend infrastructure changes.

---

## üîπ Global Anycast

* BGP advertises the same static IPs from multiple edge locations.
* Traffic is **routed to the nearest edge location** based on network topology and client location.

---

## üîπ Endpoint Groups

* One per AWS Region.
* Can assign:

  * **Traffic weights**
  * **Health check configurations**
  * **Failover priority**

---

## üîπ Health Checks

* TCP or HTTP-based checks.
* Configure:

  * Port
  * Path (for HTTP)
  * Interval
  * Thresholds
* **Unhealthy endpoints are automatically removed** from routing.

---

## üîπ Routing Policies

* **Weighted routing**: Distribute traffic based on custom weights across regions.
* **Failover routing**: Automatically fallback to other regions if primary endpoints are unhealthy.

## üîπ Cost Considerations

| Cost Component                | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accelerator hourly charge** | Charged per accelerator.                                                        |
| **Data transfer cost**        | Outbound traffic over the accelerator. Higher than standard AWS transfer rates. |
| **Additional IP addresses**   | Charged if using more than default two static IPs.                              |

* **Estimate costs** using the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws.amazon.com/).
* Cost grows with volume and geographical spread.

## üîπ Troubleshooting Techniques

1. **Check Health Check Logs**

   * Use CloudWatch logs for diagnostics.
   * Ensure your application responds on the configured health check path/port.

2. **CloudWatch Metrics**

   * Monitor `ClientConnectionErrorCount`, `HealthyEndpointCount`, `EndpointResponseTime`.

3. **Use VPC Flow Logs**

   * Inspect network behavior from edge to endpoints.

4. **Confirm Routing**

   * Use `dig` or `traceroute` to verify anycast IP routing.

5. **Test Failover**

   * Simulate endpoint failure and ensure traffic routes to other healthy regions.

6. **Validate Security Groups**

   * Ensure endpoints accept traffic on listener port from Global Accelerator IPs.
