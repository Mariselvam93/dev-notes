## **Real-time AWS Architecture Example**
### **Use Case: Scalable Web Application**
A company wants to deploy a **highly available** and **scalable** e-commerce website using AWS.

### **AWS Services Used:**
- **Compute:** Amazon EC2 (for hosting the web application) with Auto Scaling.
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 (for storing product images and user uploads).
- **Database:** Amazon RDS (for structured data like user accounts, orders).
- **Networking:** Amazon VPC (to isolate resources securely).
- **Security:** AWS IAM (for managing access control).
- **Load Balancing:** Elastic Load Balancer (to distribute traffic).
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch (for logging and alerts).

### **Architecture Flow:**
1. **User Requests:** A user visits the e-commerce website (hosted on EC2).
2. **Load Balancing:** The request is routed through **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Product details and user information are fetched from **Amazon RDS**.
4. **Image Storage:** Product images are stored in **Amazon S3**.
5. **Auto Scaling:** If traffic spikes, **Auto Scaling Group** launches new EC2 instances.
6. **Security Controls:** IAM policies enforce **least privilege access** for developers.
7. **Monitoring:** **CloudWatch** tracks application health and performance.

This setup ensures:
âœ… **High availability** (Multi-AZ RDS, ELB, Auto Scaling).  
âœ… **Scalability** (Auto Scaling adjusts resources).  
âœ… **Cost Optimization** (Use of S3 for static content, auto-scaling reduces unused capacity).
