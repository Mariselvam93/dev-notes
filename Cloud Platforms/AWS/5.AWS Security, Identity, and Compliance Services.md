✅ **Use AWS Shield Advanced for mission-critical applications**  
✅ **Enable AWS WAF to filter malicious traffic**  

---

### **6️⃣ AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
**Purpose:** Protect web applications from SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other exploits.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- **Web ACLs (Access Control Lists)** → Define security rules  
- **Managed Rule Groups** → Pre-configured security filters  
- **Rate-based rules** → Prevent bot attacks  

🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✅ **Deploy WAF with CloudFront for global protection**  
✅ **Use rate limiting to block excessive requests**  

---

### **7️⃣ Amazon GuardDuty (Threat Detection)**
**Purpose:** AI-powered security monitoring for AWS workloads.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- **Detects suspicious API calls, IAM anomalies, and unauthorized access**  
- **Monitors VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, and DNS Logs**  
- **Alerts security teams in real-time**  

🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✅ **Enable GuardDuty across all AWS accounts**  
✅ **Integrate GuardDuty with AWS Security Hub for centralized alerts**  

---

### **8️⃣ AWS Security Hub (Centralized Security Management)**
**Purpose:** Unifies security alerts across AWS services.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- **Aggregates findings from GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer, and Macie**  
- **Provides AWS Security Score & best practice recommendations**  

🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✅ **Use AWS Organizations integration for multi-account security visibility**  
✅ **Regularly review Security Hub findings to fix vulnerabilities**  

---

### **9️⃣ Amazon Inspector (Vulnerability Management)**
**Purpose:** Automates security assessment of EC2 instances and container images.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- **Scans for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations**  
- **Works with AWS Systems Manager for patch management**  

🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✅ **Enable Inspector on all EC2 instances**  
✅ **Automate vulnerability patching using AWS Systems Manager**  

---

### **🔟 AWS Identity Center (AWS SSO)**
**Purpose:** Centralized authentication across AWS accounts and business apps.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- **SSO with Active Directory, Google, Okta, etc.**
