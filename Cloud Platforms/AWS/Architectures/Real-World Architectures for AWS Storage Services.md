## **1️⃣ Multi-Region Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3 + CloudFront**
### **🛠️ Use Case:**  
- Hosting a globally available static website with **low latency** and **high availability**.  
- Reducing **server costs** by eliminating web servers (fully serverless).

### **🔹 Architecture:**
- **Amazon S3** stores static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos).  
- **Amazon CloudFront** caches and serves content globally.  
- **Amazon Route 53** provides DNS-based traffic routing.  
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** secures the site with **HTTPS**.

### **✅ Steps to Implement**
1. **Upload website files to an S3 bucket.**  
2. **Enable static website hosting** in S3.  
3. **Create a CloudFront distribution** and set S3 as the origin.  
4. **Use Route 53** to point a custom domain to CloudFront.  
5. **Enable AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for HTTPS security.  

### **🔥 Benefits:**
✔ **99.999999999% durability** (S3).  
✔ **Low latency via CloudFront's global CDN.**  
✔ **Scalability and cost savings** (serverless).

## **2️⃣ High-Performance Application with Amazon EBS (Databases on EC2)**
### **🛠️ Use Case:**  
- Running **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Oracle** on EC2.  
- Ensuring **high availability and durability** with **automated snapshots**.

### **🔹 Architecture:**
- **Amazon EC2** instance runs the database.  
- **Amazon EBS (gp3 or io2 volumes)** provides persistent storage.  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** monitors performance and health.  
- **Amazon S3** stores **EBS snapshots** for disaster recovery.  
- **AWS Backup** automates snapshot creation.

### **✅ Steps to Implement**
1. **Launch an EC2 instance** and attach an EBS volume.  
2. **Format and mount the EBS volume** for database storage.  
3. **Enable automated snapshots** to S3 for backup.  
4. **Monitor disk performance** using CloudWatch metrics.  

### **🔥 Benefits:**
✔ **High durability with snapshots** stored in S3.  
✔ **Scalability by resizing EBS volumes** (gp3).  
✔ **Improved performance with io2 volumes** for high IOPS workloads.

## **3️⃣ Shared Storage for Auto-Scaling Web Applications using Amazon EFS**
### **🛠️ Use Case:**  
- Web applications requiring **shared storage** for multiple EC2 instances.  
- Use cases: **Media storage, web servers, machine learning datasets**.

### **🔹 Architecture:**
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group** launches multiple instances.  
- **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)** provides **shared storage**.  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** distributes traffic.  
- **Amazon RDS or DynamoDB** manages databases.

### **✅ Steps to Implement**
1. **Create an EFS file system** in AWS.  
2. **Attach the EFS volume** to multiple EC2 instances.  
3. **Configure security groups** for secure NFS access.  
4. **Mount the EFS file system** in EC2 instances.  
5. **Auto-scale EC2 instances** as traffic grows.  

### **🔥 Benefits:**
✔ **Fully managed and auto-scaling** (no storage limits).  
✔ **Multi-AZ high availability** (99.99% uptime).  
✔ **Low-latency shared file system** across multiple instances.

## **4️⃣ Archival and Compliance Data Storage with S3 Glacier**
### **🛠️ Use Case:**  
- Storing **regulatory compliance data** (e.g., medical records, audit logs).  
- Reducing storage costs for **rarely accessed data**.

### **🔹 Architecture:**
- **Amazon S3** stores frequently accessed data.  
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies** automatically move old data to **S3 Glacier**.  
- **AWS Backup and AWS Glue** index and retrieve data when needed.

### **✅ Steps to Implement**
1. **Store compliance data in S3** (hot storage).  
2. **Configure Lifecycle Rules** to transition files to Glacier after X days.  
3. **Enable S3 Object Lock** for Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) compliance.  
4. **Use AWS Athena or AWS Glue** to query archived data when needed.  

### **🔥 Benefits:**
✔ **Up to 90% cheaper than standard S3.**  
✔ **Automatic data archival with lifecycle rules.**  
✔ **Retrieval options**: Instant, expedited, bulk retrieval.

## **5️⃣ Hybrid Cloud Storage with AWS Storage Gateway**
### **🛠️ Use Case:**  
- Extending on-premises storage **to AWS** for **backup and disaster recovery**.  
- **Hybrid workloads** with **low-latency local access** and **cloud scalability**.

### **🔹 Architecture:**
- **Storage Gateway (File Gateway, Tape Gateway, or Volume Gateway).**  
- **Amazon S3 for cloud storage.**  
- **AWS Snowball for initial data migration.**  

### **✅ Steps to Implement**
1. **Deploy AWS Storage Gateway on-premises.**  
2. **Connect Storage Gateway to Amazon S3.**  
3. **Sync local files with S3** for offsite backups.  
4. **Use S3 lifecycle policies** to transition old data to Glacier.  

### **🔥 Benefits:**
✔ **Hybrid cloud storage with low latency.**  
✔ **Seamless integration with on-prem NAS/SAN storage.**  
✔ **Automated backup and disaster recovery.**

## **🚀 Comparison of AWS Storage Architectures**
| **Architecture** | **Best For** | **Key AWS Services** |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Static Website Hosting** | Serverless, global web content | S3, CloudFront, Route 53 |
| **High-Performance Databases** | Low-latency, high-performance apps | EC2, EBS, CloudWatch |
| **Shared Storage for Web Apps** | Auto-scaling apps, ML datasets | EFS, EC2, Load Balancer |
| **Compliance & Archival Storage** | Regulatory data, logs, backups | S3 Glacier, Lifecycle Policies |
| **Hybrid Cloud Storage** | On-prem to AWS storage extension | Storage Gateway, S3 |

## **💰 Cost Optimization for AWS Storage**
- **Use S3 Lifecycle Rules** to automatically transition data to cheaper tiers (e.g., Glacier, Intelligent-Tiering).  
- **Use gp3 for EBS volumes** (cheaper and more flexible than gp2).  
- **Use EFS Infrequent Access** for storing rarely used files.  
- **Delete unused snapshots** to avoid unnecessary EBS costs.  
- **Enable compression and deduplication** on stored data.
