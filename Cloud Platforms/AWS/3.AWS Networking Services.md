## **1️⃣ Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
### **🔹 What is Amazon VPC?**  
Amazon VPC allows you to **launch AWS resources in a logically isolated network** with complete control over networking components.

### **🔹 Key Features**
✔ **Custom Subnetting** – Define Public and Private subnets.  
✔ **Security** – Security Groups (SGs) & Network ACLs (Network Access Control Lists).  
✔ **Custom Route Tables** – Control traffic routing between subnets.  
✔ **VPC Peering & Transit Gateway** – Connect VPCs privately.  
✔ **VPC Endpoints & PrivateLink** – Securely connect AWS services within VPC.  

### **🛠️ How to Create an Amazon VPC?**
1️⃣ Open AWS Console → Go to **VPC Dashboard**.  
2️⃣ Click **Create VPC** → Define **IPv4 CIDR Block**.  
3️⃣ Create **Public & Private Subnets**.  
4️⃣ Configure **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for Public Subnet.  
5️⃣ Add **Route Table Entries** for private/public communication.  

### **🔥 Best Practices**
✅ Use **multi-AZ deployments** for high availability.  
✅ Deploy **NAT Gateway** in public subnet for private subnet internet access.  
✅ Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for monitoring traffic.  

### **🖥️ Real-World Example:**
- A **multi-tier application** with:
  - **Public Subnet:** Web servers (EC2) with an **Elastic Load Balancer**.
  - **Private Subnet:** Application servers & **Amazon RDS**.
  - **NAT Gateway:** Allows private instances to access the internet.

## **2️⃣ Amazon Route 53 (DNS & Domain Name System)**
### **🔹 What is Route 53?**  
A **highly available** and **scalable DNS service** used for domain registration, traffic routing, and health checks.

### **🔹 Key Features**
✔ **Domain Registration** – Buy and manage domain names.  
✔ **Routing Policies** – Simple, Weighted, Latency-based, Failover, Geolocation, Multi-value.  
✔ **Health Checks** – Automatically detect unhealthy endpoints and reroute traffic.  

### **🛠️ How to Set Up Route 53?**
1️⃣ Register a domain or use an existing one.  
2️⃣ Create a **Hosted Zone** in Route 53.  
3️⃣ Add **A, CNAME, MX, TXT records** for routing.  
4️⃣ Configure **Traffic Routing Policies**.  

### **🔥 Best Practices**
✅ Use **failover routing** for disaster recovery.  
✅ Integrate **CloudFront** for better latency performance.  
✅ Enable **health checks** to improve reliability.  

### **🖥️ Real-World Example:**
- A global e-commerce website using **Geolocation Routing** to **redirect users to the nearest region** for better latency.

## **3️⃣ Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
### **🔹 What is ELB?**  
ELB **distributes traffic** across multiple EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses.

### **🔹 Types of Load Balancers**
✔ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS, path-based routing).  
✔ **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – Layer 4 (TCP/UDP, low-latency traffic).  
✔ **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** – Legacy (Avoid using in new projects).  

### **🛠️ How to Create an ELB?**
1️⃣ Navigate to **EC2 → Load Balancers** → Create Load Balancer.  
2️⃣ Choose **ALB/NLB/CLB** based on use case.  
3️⃣ Define **listeners** (HTTP, HTTPS).  
4️⃣ Attach a **target group** (EC2 instances, Lambda, IP).  

### **🔥 Best Practices**
✅ Use **ALB for modern applications** with microservices.  
✅ Enable **SSL/TLS termination** for security.  
✅ Use **NLB for real-time applications** (gaming, finance, streaming).  

### **🖥️ Real-World Example:**
- A **microservices-based** application uses **ALB** with path-based routing:
  - `/api/orders → Orders Service`
  - `/api/users → User Service`
  - `/api/payments → Payment Service`

## **4️⃣ AWS Direct Connect**
### **🔹 What is Direct Connect?**  
Direct Connect provides a **dedicated network connection** between **on-premises data centers and AWS**.

### **🔹 Key Benefits**
✔ **Lower Latency** – Faster than VPN connections.  
✔ **Higher Bandwidth** – Up to **10 Gbps**.  
✔ **Secure & Reliable** – Avoids public internet traffic.  

### **🛠️ How to Set Up AWS Direct Connect?**
1️⃣ Request **Direct Connect** in AWS Console.  
2️⃣ Connect to **AWS Partner Colocation** (Equinix, Megaport).  
3️⃣ Establish **BGP sessions** for routing.  

### **🔥 Best Practices**
✅ Use **multiple Direct Connect links** for redundancy.  
✅ Combine with **AWS VPN** for failover.  

### **🖥️ Real-World Example:**
- A financial services company connects **on-prem data centers to AWS** for **low-latency trading applications**.

A **global CDN** that delivers content **with low latency** by caching data at **Edge Locations**.

### **🔹 Key Features**
✔ **DDoS Protection** – Built-in with AWS Shield.  
✔ **HTTPS Support** – Secure content delivery.  
✔ **Lambda@Edge** – Customize request/response behavior at edge locations.  

### **🛠️ How to Set Up CloudFront?**
1️⃣ Create a **CloudFront Distribution**.  
2️⃣ Set an **Origin (S3, EC2, ALB, API Gateway)**.  
3️⃣ Enable **Caching & TTL (Time To Live)** settings.  

### **🔥 Best Practices**
✅ Use **CloudFront with S3** for low-cost static site hosting.  
✅ Enable **origin failover** for disaster recovery.  
✅ Integrate **AWS WAF** for security.  

### **🖥️ Real-World Example:**
- A **video streaming platform** caches videos globally using CloudFront for **buffer-free streaming**.
