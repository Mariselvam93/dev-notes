## 📌 **1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
### 🔹 Overview  
Amazon EC2 provides **resizable compute capacity** in the cloud. It allows you to launch **virtual machines (EC2 instances)** and configure them with CPU, memory, storage, and networking.  

### 🔹 Features  
- **Instance Types** → General Purpose (T, M), Compute Optimized (C), Memory Optimized (R, X), GPU (P, G), Storage Optimized (I, D).  
- **Elastic IPs** → Static public IPs for instances.  
- **Security Groups** → Acts as a firewall for EC2.  
- **Auto Scaling** → Automatically adjusts capacity.  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** → Distributes traffic to EC2 instances.  
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Images)** → Pre-configured OS + software images.  
- **Instance Store vs. EBS** → Temporary vs. persistent storage.  

### 🔹 How to Create an EC2 Instance  
1️⃣ **Go to EC2 Dashboard** → Launch Instance.  
2️⃣ **Choose AMI** → Select OS (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows).  
3️⃣ **Select Instance Type** → Choose vCPU, RAM.  
4️⃣ **Configure Networking** → VPC, Subnet, Security Groups.  
5️⃣ **Add Storage** → EBS volumes.  
6️⃣ **Add Key Pair** → SSH access to instance.  
7️⃣ **Launch Instance!** 🎉  

### 🔹 Best Practices  
✅ Use **IAM roles** instead of storing credentials on EC2.  
✅ Place instances in **private subnets** (if not public-facing).  
✅ Use **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for HA.  
✅ Use **Auto Scaling** to handle traffic spikes.  
✅ Enable **CloudWatch monitoring** for performance tracking.  
✅ **Harden security** (disable root login, allow SSH only via bastion host).  

### 🔹 Real-World Use Case  
**Hosting a Web Application** → Deploy a high-traffic web app using **EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling**, and a **RDS database** in a **Multi-AZ setup** for high availability.
