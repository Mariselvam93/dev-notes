Here are **AWS Compute Best Practices** organized by key areas such as architecture, performance, cost, scalability, and security:

---

## 🔧 1. **Architecture and Design**

### ✅ Use the Right Compute Service for the Job

* **EC2**: For full control over the OS and server-level customization.
* **Lambda**: For event-driven, short-lived tasks with no server management.
* **ECS/EKS**: For container orchestration (use Fargate for serverless containers).
* **Lightsail**: For simple applications and easy-to-use environments.
* **Elastic Beanstalk**: For quick deployments without worrying about infrastructure.

### ✅ Design for Failure

* Deploy across **multiple Availability Zones (AZs)**.
* Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to maintain availability.
* Ensure **load balancing** (e.g., with ELB) between instances/services.

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Performance Optimization**

### ✅ Right-Size Instances

* Use **AWS Compute Optimizer** to recommend instance types and sizes based on actual usage.
* Select the latest **generation instances** for better performance/cost.

### ✅ Use Enhanced Networking

* Enable **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)** or **EFA** for high throughput and low latency.

### ✅ Optimize for Workload

* Use **Compute-optimized instances (C family)** for CPU-bound tasks.
* Use **Memory-optimized (R family)** or **Storage-optimized (I family)** for specific needs.

---

## 💰 3. **Cost Management**

### ✅ Use Spot Instances

* For fault-tolerant or flexible workloads (e.g., batch processing, big data jobs).

### ✅ Use Auto Scaling

* Scale out/in based on actual demand to avoid over-provisioning.

### ✅ Purchase Savings Plans or Reserved Instances

* For predictable workloads, commit usage to reduce costs.

### ✅ Monitor with Cost Explorer

* Track usage, detect anomalies, and optimize cost over time.

---

## 📈 4. **Scalability and Elasticity**

### ✅ Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

* Scale horizontally based on CloudWatch metrics.

### ✅ Use AWS Lambda for Scale-Out Events

* Automatically scales with incoming requests (serverless model).

### ✅ Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

* Distribute incoming traffic across multiple compute resources.

---

## 🔐 5. **Security and Compliance**

### ✅ Use IAM Roles and Policies

* Never hard-code credentials; use IAM roles attached to compute resources.

### ✅ Patch EC2 Instances Regularly

* Use **Systems Manager Patch Manager** to automate patching.

### ✅ Use Security Groups and NACLs

* Restrict traffic at instance and subnet level.

### ✅ Enable Monitoring and Logging

* Use **CloudWatch**, **CloudTrail**, and **VPC Flow Logs**.

---

## 🧰 6. **Monitoring and Observability**

### ✅ Enable CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

* Monitor CPU, memory (with agents), disk I/O, and custom metrics.

### ✅ Use AWS X-Ray

* For distributed tracing of requests across services (especially Lambda and API Gateway).

### ✅ Tag Resources

* For better organization, cost allocation, and automation.

---

## ☁️ 7. **Deployment and Automation**

### ✅ Use Infrastructure as Code

* Tools like **CloudFormation**, **CDK**, or **Terraform** to automate deployments.

### ✅ Use Blue/Green or Canary Deployments

* To minimize downtime and reduce risk.

### ✅ Use CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, or GitHub Actions

* Automate deployment pipelines for CI/CD.
