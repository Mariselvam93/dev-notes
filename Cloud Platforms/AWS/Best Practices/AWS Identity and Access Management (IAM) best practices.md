Here are **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices** to help secure your AWS environment:

---

### 🔐 **1. Use Least Privilege Principle**

* **Grant only the permissions required** for users, roles, and services to perform their tasks.
* Use **AWS managed policies** to start and refine using **customer managed policies** for precise control.

---

### 🧑‍💼 **2. Use IAM Roles Instead of IAM Users Where Possible**

* For applications or services (like EC2, Lambda, ECS), **use IAM roles**.
* Avoid long-term credentials by leveraging **temporary security credentials** via roles.

---

### 🔑 **3. Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**

* Require MFA for all users with console access, especially for privileged accounts (e.g., root, admins).
* Use **virtual MFA devices** (like Google Authenticator or Authy) or **hardware MFA tokens**.

---

### 👑 **4. Lock Down the Root Account**

* **Never use the root account** for daily operations.
* Enable MFA, and securely store credentials for emergencies only.

---

### 🏷️ **5. Use Groups to Assign Permissions**

* Assign permissions to IAM groups rather than individual users for easier access management.
* Example: `Developers`, `Auditors`, `Admins`.

---

### 📋 **6. Regularly Review and Rotate Credentials**

* Audit IAM users, roles, and their permissions periodically.
* Rotate **access keys** and **passwords** on a regular schedule.
* Disable or delete unused users and keys.

---

### 🔍 **7. Monitor and Log IAM Activity**

* Enable **AWS CloudTrail** to log IAM API calls.
* Use **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** or **AWS Config** to alert on suspicious IAM activity.

---

### 🧪 **8. Test Policies Using IAM Access Analyzer & Policy Simulator**

* Verify what access your policies grant with **IAM Access Analyzer**.
* Use the **IAM Policy Simulator** before applying changes to ensure policies work as intended.

---

### 🏗️ **9. Use Conditions in IAM Policies**

* Apply conditions like:

  * IP restrictions (`aws:SourceIp`)
  * Time-based access
  * MFA requirement (`aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`)
  * Specific VPC or service

---

### 📦 **10. Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) with AWS Organizations**

* Use SCPs to define permission boundaries across accounts.
* Prevent certain actions regardless of the permissions granted to IAM users/roles.

---

### 📁 **11. Separate Environments by Account**

* Use different AWS accounts for **dev**, **test**, and **prod**.
* This limits the blast radius and improves auditing.

---

### ⚙️ **12. Use Session Tags and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

* Tag IAM users and roles with attributes (like `Department`, `Project`).
* Use **ABAC** to manage permissions dynamically based on these tags.
