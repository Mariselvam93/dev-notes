U# 📘 AWS DHCP Options Set

## 🧾 What is it?
A **DHCP Options Set** in AWS is a configuration attached to a **VPC** that defines how DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) provides network configuration parameters to instances.

---

## 🔧 Key Components

| Option Name        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `domain-name`      | The DNS domain name (e.g., `ec2.internal`, `example.com`)                   |
| `domain-name-servers` | IP addresses of DNS servers (e.g., AmazonProvidedDNS or custom IPs)     |
| `ntp-servers`      | Network Time Protocol servers IP addresses (optional)                      |
| `netbios-name-servers` | IP addresses for NetBIOS name servers (for Windows networking)         |
| `netbios-node-type` | Type of NetBIOS node (1: broadcast, 2: peer-peer, 8: hybrid - recommended) |

---

## 🗂️ How It Works

- Instances in a VPC **automatically use** the associated DHCP options set when they are launched.
- AWS provides a **default DHCP options set** per region.
- You can **create custom sets** for use cases like:
  - Using **on-premises DNS** with hybrid cloud setups.
  - Defining a **custom domain** for internal resolution.
  - Overriding the **default Amazon DNS** settings.

---

## ⚙️ Usage Examples

- **Hybrid environments**: Point EC2 instances to on-prem DNS (e.g., Active Directory).
- **Custom domain**: Use a company’s private DNS suffix.
- **Time sync**: Set custom NTP servers for consistent timekeeping.

---

## 🚧 Considerations

- You can **associate only one DHCP options set per VPC**.
- Changing the DHCP options set will affect **new DHCP leases only** (e.g., after reboot/reconnect).
- Cannot directly modify a DHCP options set — must **create a new one** and associate it with the VPC.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **AmazonProvidedDNS** unless you have specific requirements.
- Always test custom options with a **staging VPC**.
- Document changes when associating a new DHCP options set.

---

## 📝 AWS CLI Tip

```bash
aws ec2 create-dhcp-options \
  --dhcp-configurations \
    "Key=domain-name,Values=example.com" \
    "Key=domain-name-servers,Values=10.0.0.2"

Here are clear and concise **study notes** on IAM policy global condition context keys like `aws:PrincipalOrgID`, `aws:PrincipalAccount`, `aws:PrincipalOrgPaths`, and others.

---

## 🔐 IAM Global Condition Context Keys: Study Notes

These condition keys are used in AWS IAM policies to **control access based on the identity of the requester**, particularly for **cross-account** or **organization-level** access control.

---

### 1. **`aws:PrincipalOrgID`**

* **Purpose**: Ensures that only principals (users, roles, etc.) from a specific **AWS Organization** can access a resource.

* **Value Type**: String

* **Example Value**: `"o-1234567890"`

* **Use Case**: Grant access only to entities from your own AWS Organization.

* **Example Policy Snippet**:

  ```json
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-1234567890"
    }
  }
  ```

* **Common Usage**: On S3 bucket policies, KMS keys, Lambda, and API Gateway to allow org-level access.

---

### 2. **`aws:PrincipalAccount`**

* **Purpose**: Restricts access to a specific AWS **account ID**.

* **Value Type**: String

* **Example Value**: `"123456789012"`

* **Use Case**: Allow access only from a particular AWS account (useful for cross-account access control).

* **Example Policy Snippet**:

  ```json
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalAccount": "123456789012"
    }
  }
  ```

* **Note**: This works well for tightly controlling who can assume a role or access a resource across accounts.

---

### 3. **`aws:PrincipalOrgPaths`**

* **Purpose**: Grants access based on the **organizational unit (OU)** hierarchy (organization path) in AWS Organizations.

* **Value Type**: String or array of strings

* **Example Value**: `"/o-1234567890/r-exampleroot/ou-abcd-1111/ou-abcd-2222/"`

* **Use Case**: Grant permissions only to principals from specific **OUs** (Organizational Units) inside your AWS Organization.

* **Example Policy Snippet**:

  ```json
  "Condition": {
    "StringLike": {
      "aws:PrincipalOrgPaths": "/o-1234567890/r-exampleroot/ou-abcd-1111/*"
    }
  }
  ```

* **Advanced Use**: Great for large orgs where different OUs have different trust levels or responsibilities.

---

## 🔄 Comparison Summary

| Condition Key           | Scope               | Typical Use Case                         | Example Value               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `aws:PrincipalOrgID`    | Entire Organization | Allow any account/user from your AWS Org | `o-1234567890`              |
| `aws:PrincipalAccount`  | Specific Account    | Allow only a specific AWS account        | `123456789012`              |
| `aws:PrincipalOrgPaths` | OU Path Hierarchy   | Fine-grained control within org OUs      | `/o-123/r-root/ou-abc-xyz/` |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* These condition keys are often used in **resource policies** (like S3 bucket policies, KMS key policies), not IAM identity policies.
* They **require AWS Organizations** to be set up and the resource/account must be a **member** of that organization.
* **`aws:PrincipalOrgPaths`** requires AWS Organizations to **support OU path resolution**, so it may have performance implications in large orgs.

---

## 📚 Use Case Example: S3 Bucket Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-1234567890"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* This ensures **only identities from your AWS Organization** can access your S3 bucket—even if the bucket is public or accessible cross-account.

## ⚡️ EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) – Study Notes

### ✅ **What is EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)?**

**Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)** is an **Amazon EBS feature** that enables you to **launch volumes from snapshots with full performance instantly**, without needing to pre-warm or initialize the data.

> Normally, when restoring a volume from an EBS snapshot, the first read from each block can have high latency. FSR eliminates this "lazy loading."

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

| Without FSR                          | With FSR                               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Volume takes time to initialize      | Immediate, full performance            |
| Reads have high latency until warmed | Low latency from first I/O             |
| Good for long-term archival          | Great for rapid boot/test environments |

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

* You **enable FSR on a snapshot** in specific Availability Zones (AZs).
* AWS pre-initializes the snapshot in the background.
* Once ready, **volumes created from the snapshot** in that AZ perform **as if they were freshly created volumes**.

---

## 💡 Key Points

* FSR is **not automatic**; you must enable it **per snapshot per AZ**.
* It may take **a few minutes to become active**.
* FSR does **not replicate** the snapshot—it **accelerates access** in the AZ.
* **Additional cost** applies (hourly per AZ per snapshot).

---

## 🧪 Example Scenario

1. You create a **snapshot** of a pre-configured EC2 instance with software.
2. You enable FSR in **`us-east-1a`**.
3. Later, you launch **test environments** from that snapshot in **`us-east-1a`**.
4. The new volumes **perform immediately** without initialization latency.

---

## 📘 Exam Tip (AWS Solutions Architect)

> FSR improves **boot time** and **data access performance** from EBS snapshots — ideal for **mission-critical, time-sensitive workloads**.

---

---

## 🔁 **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**

### 📌 **What is RPO?**

**RPO** defines **how much data you can afford to lose** in case of a failure — in time terms (e.g., 5 minutes of data).

---

### 🕐 **PITR & RPO**

* DynamoDB with PITR offers **near-zero RPO** — since it can restore to any second.
* **Max RPO ≈ few seconds**, depending on how fast data is committed.

---

### 🧠 Exam Tip

> Use **PITR** when your application requires **minimal data loss (low RPO)** and the ability to **recover from accidental writes or deletes**.

Here are concise study notes on **AWS Config Rule to check certificate expiry**, including how it works and how to implement it:

---

## ✅ **AWS Config Rule to Check Certificate Expiry**

### 📘 **What is AWS Config?**

**AWS Config** is a service that **monitors and records AWS resource configurations** and lets you **evaluate compliance** against desired configurations using **Config Rules**.

---

### 🔎 **Use Case: Monitor SSL/TLS Certificate Expiry**

You want to ensure that your **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** certificates are **not expiring soon**, to avoid service disruptions.

---

## 🛠️ **How to Implement Certificate Expiry Rule**

### Option 1: **Use AWS Managed Rule**

* **Rule Name:** `acm-certificate-expiration-check`
* **Scope:** Checks **ACM certificates** for expiration within a configurable number of days.

### 🔧 **Configurable Parameters**

| Parameter          | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `daysToExpiration` | Number of days before expiration to trigger noncompliance (e.g., `30`) |

### Example:

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "acm-certificate-expiration-check",
  "SourceIdentifier": "ACM_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION_CHECK",
  "InputParameters": {
    "daysToExpiration": "30"
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 What It Does:

* Evaluates **ACM certificates**.
* If a certificate **expires within the next X days**, it is marked **NON\_COMPLIANT**.
* Supports **CloudWatch and SNS notifications** for alerts.

---

## 🔐 **Permissions Needed**

To use the rule, AWS Config must have permission to read ACM certificate details:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "acm:ListCertificates",
    "acm:DescribeCertificate"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

### 🚨 Alerts & Remediation (Optional)

* **SNS**: Trigger an email/Slack alert when a cert is close to expiration.
* **Automation**: Trigger a **Lambda** function to renew/notify on certificate expiry.

---

### 🧠 Exam Tip:

> Use **`acm-certificate-expiration-check`** to ensure ACM certificates don’t expire without notice. This is a **managed rule**, so it's easy to configure with minimal effort.

---
Here are clear explanations on both requested topics:

## 📡 **Reserved IP Addresses in an AWS VPC Subnet**

When you create a subnet in an Amazon VPC, **AWS reserves 5 IP addresses** in each subnet for internal networking purposes.

Assume a subnet like `10.0.0.0/24`. Here's what the reserved addresses mean:

| **IP Address** | **Purpose**                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0`     | **Network address** – Identifies the subnet; not assignable to instances.                    |
| `10.0.0.1`     | **VPC router** – Used by AWS as the default gateway for the subnet.                          |
| `10.0.0.2`     | **DNS server** – AWS DNS service IP (base + 2); used by instances for DNS.                   |
| `10.0.0.3`     | **Reserved for future use** – Not currently used by AWS.                                     |
| `10.0.0.255`   | **Broadcast address** – Not used in AWS (VPC doesn't support broadcast), but still reserved. |

> 📝 So, for a `/24` subnet (256 addresses), only **251 IPs are usable** by EC2 or other resources.

---

## 🔐 **Explicit Allow and Deny in IAM Policies**

### 🔹 **Explicit Allow**

* Grants a **specific permission** to a resource or action.
* Default behavior in IAM: **No access unless explicitly allowed**.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
}
```

### 🔸 **Explicit Deny**

* **Overrides any Allow**, even if permissions are granted elsewhere (like in another policy or group).
* Used to **restrict access under certain conditions**, or for security hardening.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/private/*"
}
```

### 🧠 **Key Points**

* If a **Deny** and **Allow** both apply to a user, **Deny wins**.
* IAM policies are **deny-by-default**. Access is only granted if **explicitly allowed**.
* **Use Deny** to block sensitive actions or define **exceptions** to broader permissions.

---
Here’s a simple explanation of **Simple** and **Target Tracking** scaling policies in **Auto Scaling**:

---

### 🔹 **1. Simple Scaling Policy**

**What it does:**
Adds or removes a fixed number of instances when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

**How it works:**

* Based on **thresholds** (e.g., CPU > 70%)
* Waits for the cooldown period before any other action

**Example:**
If CPU > 70%, **add 2 instances**
If CPU < 30%, **remove 1 instance**

**Use when:**
You want **manual control** over how many instances are added or removed.

---

### 🔸 **2. Target Tracking Scaling Policy**

**What it does:**
Automatically adjusts capacity to keep a specific metric (e.g., CPU) at a target value.

**How it works:**

* You set a **target value** (e.g., keep CPU at 50%)
* Auto Scaling **automatically calculates** how many instances to add/remove
* No need to define alarms manually

**Example:**
Keep average **CPU utilization at 50%**
→ It may add/remove instances automatically to maintain that.

**Use when:**
You want **automatic and smart scaling** based on a target (like CPU, request count, etc.)

---

### ✅ Quick Comparison

| Feature   | Simple Scaling        | Target Tracking           |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Trigger   | CloudWatch Alarm      | Target metric (like CPU%) |
| Control   | Manual (fixed number) | Automatic (calculated)    |
| Cooldown  | Required              | Managed automatically     |
| Ideal for | Basic setups          | Most common use cases     |

### 📨 SQS Extended Client Library — Overview

The **Amazon SQS Extended Client Library** is an extension of the standard AWS SDK for SQS that supports sending **large message payloads** via **Amazon S3** instead of directly through SQS.

---

### 🔧 Why It’s Needed

* **SQS max message size** = 256 KB.
* When messages exceed this size (e.g., large JSON, images, reports), the extended client:

  * **Stores payload in S3**.
  * Sends a **pointer (reference)** to the S3 object in the actual SQS message.

---

### ✅ Key Features

| Feature                         | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large message support**       | Send/receive messages > 256 KB by storing payload in S3.                    |
| **Seamless integration**        | Wraps the standard `AmazonSQS` client.                                      |
| **Automatic storage/retrieval** | Handles upload/download from S3 internally.                                 |
| **S3-managed lifecycle**        | Can be configured to automatically delete payload from S3 after processing. |

---

### 🛠️ How It Works (Flow)

1. **Producer**:

   * Uploads the large payload to S3.
   * Sends a pointer (e.g., S3 bucket/key) in the SQS message.

2. **Consumer**:

   * Receives the pointer from SQS.
   * Downloads the full payload from S3 automatically.

---

### 🚀 Example Use Case

* Sending **large event data**, **logs**, or **files** between distributed systems or microservices that rely on SQS queues.

---

### ⚠️ Things to Consider

* **S3 costs** apply (storage, PUT/GET).
* **IAM permissions** are required for both SQS and S3 access.
* **Reliability**: Ensure cleanup if a message is not successfully processed (to avoid S3 orphaned objects).

---

### 🧪 Sample Code (Java)

```java
AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.defaultClient();
AmazonSQS sqs = AmazonSQSClientBuilder.defaultClient();

ExtendedClientConfiguration extendedConfig = new ExtendedClientConfiguration()
    .withLargePayloadSupportEnabled(s3, "my-bucket")
    .withAlwaysThroughS3(true);

AmazonSQSExtendedClient sqsExtendedClient = new AmazonSQSExtendedClient(sqs, extendedConfig);

SendMessageRequest request = new SendMessageRequest()
    .withQueueUrl(queueUrl)
    .withMessageBody(largePayloadString);

sqsExtendedClient.sendMessage(request);
```

Here are **concise study notes** on **Provisioned Concurrency in AWS Lambda**:

---

### ⚙️ **Provisioned Concurrency in AWS Lambda – Notes**

#### 🚀 What Is It?

* **Provisioned Concurrency** ensures that a pre-defined number of Lambda instances are **initialized and ready to serve requests instantly**.
* It eliminates **cold starts** — the latency that occurs during the first invocation or after a period of inactivity.

---

### 🔄 How It Works

* You **configure** a set number of concurrent instances to stay warm.
* AWS **keeps them initialized** with your function’s code and dependencies loaded.
* These instances are used **before any new ones are initialized** during traffic spikes.

---

### 🧩 Use Cases

* **Performance-critical applications** like:

  * APIs with **predictable traffic** (e.g., morning spike)
  * **Low-latency applications**
  * **Gaming backends**
  * **Real-time processing systems**

---

### 💵 Cost Consideration

* You are **billed separately** for:

  * **Provisioned concurrency** (per minute)
  * **Invocation time** (standard Lambda pricing)

---

### ⚙️ How to Configure

* Via:

  * AWS Console (under Lambda → Versions → Aliases → Provisioned Concurrency)
  * AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    aws lambda put-provisioned-concurrency-config \
      --function-name my-function \
      --qualifier prod \
      --provisioned-concurrent-executions 10
    ```
  * Infrastructure as Code tools (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform)

---

### 🔄 Auto Scaling Option

* You can use **Application Auto Scaling** to adjust provisioned concurrency based on:

  * **Schedule**
  * **Utilization metrics**

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Eliminates cold start latency**
* **Predictable performance**
* **Reduce Latency**
* Works well with **API Gateway**, **AppSync**, and **ALB**

---

---

### 📝 Notes: Automating EC2 & RDS Start/Stop with Minimal Cost

#### ✅ **Best Solution:**

**Use AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge**

* **Lambda**: Serverless function to start/stop EC2 & RDS instances.
* **EventBridge**: Triggers Lambda on a cron schedule (e.g., outside business hours).
* **No infrastructure maintenance**.
* **Cost-effective** (only pay for Lambda execution time).

---

#### 🛠️ **Why It Works:**

* Automates **resource scheduling** (e.g., stop at 7 PM, start at 7 AM).
* Can scale to multiple EC2/RDS instances.
* Uses **AWS SDK (Boto3 / SDK for .NET, Java, etc.)** to manage resources.
* Fully managed and secure.

---

#### 🚫 Alternatives & Drawbacks:

* **Crontab on EC2 (Option C)**: Adds EC2 cost and maintenance.
* **Marketplace Tools (Option B)**: May add extra cost and complexity.
* **Elastic Resize / Scale to Zero (Option A)**:

  * EC2 doesn’t support "scale to zero."
  * RDS can't be scaled to zero (except Aurora Serverless v2).

---
### 📝 POSIX-Compliant Storage 
---

### 📌 What is POSIX?

**POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of IEEE standards that ensures compatibility and interoperability between different Unix-like operating systems. For file systems, **POSIX compliance** means the storage supports standard file and directory operations like:

* `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
* File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
* Symbolic links, hard links
* Locking, metadata (e.g., timestamps, ownership)
* Directory traversal with `ls`, `cd`, etc.

---

### ✅ Key Characteristics of POSIX-Compliant Storage:

* **Hierarchical file system structure**
* **User/Group/Other permission model**
* **Concurrent access with file locking**
* **Strong consistency** (immediate visibility of file changes)
* **Standard I/O system calls**

---

### 📦 AWS Services Offering POSIX-Compliant Storage:

| AWS Service                          | POSIX Compliance | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon EFS** (Elastic File System) | ✅ Yes            | Fully managed NFS (v4.1, v4.0) file system for Linux-based workloads.  |
| **Amazon FSx for Lustre**            | ✅ Yes            | High-performance file system used for HPC, ML – supports POSIX API.    |
| **Amazon FSx for OpenZFS**           | ✅ Yes            | OpenZFS-based POSIX-compliant storage. Suitable for Unix workloads.    |
| **Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP**      | ✅ Yes            | Fully managed ONTAP storage – supports NFS, SMB with POSIX compliance. |

---

### 🚫 Not POSIX-Compliant:

| Service            | Reason                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon S3**      | Object storage – lacks file system semantics like directories, permissions, or file locking. |
| **Amazon Glacier** | Archival object storage – not designed for POSIX file access.                                |

---

### 🛠 Use Cases for POSIX-Compliant Storage:

* Traditional Linux/Unix applications
* Legacy enterprise apps that expect local or NFS-style file access
* HPC workloads (e.g., genomics, financial simulations)
* Shared home directories and configuration storage

---
### 📝 Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) Storage Tiers – Quick Notes

---

### 📦 EFS Storage Classes:

Amazon EFS offers **two main storage classes**, each with **two access tiers**, optimized for different performance and cost needs.

---

### 1. **Standard Storage Class**

* Designed for **frequently accessed files**.
* Higher performance, **higher cost**.
* Ideal for active workloads like:

  * Web servers
  * Application home directories
  * Dev/test environments

---

### 2. **Infrequent Access (IA) Storage Class**

* For **files not accessed every day**.
* **Up to 92% lower cost** than Standard.
* **Retrieval fee** applies per GB when accessed.
* Great for:

  * Backups
  * Logs
  * Archive-style data

---

### 🎛️ EFS Access Tiers

| Access Tier         | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EFS Standard**    | Default for frequent access, low latency.                                            |
| **EFS Standard-IA** | Infrequent access, lower cost.                                                       |
| **EFS One Zone**    | Like Standard but within a single AZ. Lower cost, **less resilient**.                |
| **EFS One Zone-IA** | Single AZ + Infrequent Access. **Lowest cost**, use with backups or replicated data. |

---

### 🔄 Lifecycle Management

* **Automatic tiering** via lifecycle policies.
* Files can move from **Standard → IA** after a set number of days (e.g., 30).
* Only applies to files **not accessed** during that period.

---

### ⚠️ Notes

* **Standard and Standard-IA** are **multi-AZ and highly available**.
* **One Zone tiers** are **single-AZ** and suitable for redundant or temporary data.

---
Here are the **notes** for the solution:

### 🛒 **Ecommerce App: Session Management Requirements**

* **Running on**: EC2 instances in Auto Scaling group behind **ALB**
* **DB**: Amazon RDS for MariaDB (Multi-AZ)
* **Need**: **Durable session management** during transactions

---

### ✅ **Correct Answers**:

**B. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table to store customer session information**

* ✅ Fully managed NoSQL DB
* ✅ Durable and highly available
* ✅ Scales well with high traffic
* ✅ Ideal for storing session state

**D. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to store customer session information**

* ✅ In-memory store, very low latency
* ✅ Supports TTL for session expiration
* ✅ Widely used for fast session storage
* ✅ Can be configured for durability with Redis replication and snapshots

---

### ❌ **Incorrect Options**:

**A. Turn on the sticky sessions feature (session affinity) on the ALB**

* ❌ Helps route users to the same instance
* ❌ **Not durable** — session data is lost if instance terminates (due to scaling)

**C. Deploy an Amazon Cognito user pool**

* ❌ Used for **authentication/authorization**, not for storing session state
* ❌ Not designed for transactional session data

**E. Use AWS Systems Manager Application Manager**

* ❌ Tool for **monitoring and managing** apps
* ❌ Not used for storing user sessions

### 📝 **Kinesis Data Streams default settings problem:  Notes:**

#### 🟡 Problem Summary:

* Application sends data to **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**.
* Every **other day**, the app **consumes** and writes data to **Amazon S3**.
* **Some data is missing** in S3.

---

### 🔍 **Analysis:**

| Option | Description                                                                         | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**  | Update the **data retention period** in Kinesis Data Streams (default is 24 hours). | ✅ **Correct**. Since the application reads the data **every other day**, the **default 24-hour retention** period would cause Kinesis to **discard** older records before they are read. |
| **B**  | Use Kinesis Producer Library (KPL).                                                 | ❌ Irrelevant to retention issue. KPL helps with performance while sending data, not with data loss due to retention settings.                                                            |
| **C**  | Increase number of shards.                                                          | ❌ Throughput might be fine. The problem is not about throttling, but **missing data** due to expired retention.                                                                          |
| **D**  | Enable S3 Versioning.                                                               | ❌ Irrelevant. S3 versioning doesn’t solve **missing** data from Kinesis. The issue is **before** data reaches S3.                                                                        |

---

### 📌 **Key Point**:

> **Kinesis Data Streams default retention period is 24 hours**. If data is not consumed within that period, it is **lost**.

---
---

### 📝 Notes:

#### 📌 Use Case Summary:

* Application receives **UDP** traffic from **remote devices**.
* Must process data **immediately** and respond if needed.
* No storage needed, but **low latency** and **rapid failover** across **Regions** are required.

### 📝 **AWS Lambda Environment Variables & Encryption with KMS**

#### 🔐 **Default Encryption Behavior:**

* When you **create or update** Lambda functions that use **environment variables**, AWS Lambda:

  * **Encrypts** them using **AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**.
  * On invocation, the variables are **decrypted** and made available to the Lambda code.

#### 🗝️ **Default KMS Key (Automatically Managed):**

* On first use in a Region, AWS Lambda **automatically creates a default service key** in AWS KMS.
* This **default key is used** to encrypt environment variables by default.

#### ⚠️ **Limitations of the Default KMS Key:**

* You **cannot use** the default key with **encryption helpers** after the function is created.
* Selecting the **default key manually** may result in **errors**.

---

#### ✅ **Using a Customer Managed KMS Key (Recommended for More Control):**

* You can **create your own KMS key** and configure the Lambda function to use it instead of the default.
* Benefits of using a **Customer Managed Key (CMK):**

  * **Key rotation** capability.
  * **Enable/disable** the key.
  * **Define granular access control** (IAM policies and key policies).
  * **Auditing** using CloudTrail logs for key usage.

### 📝 **Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring vs. CloudWatch Metrics**

#### 📊 **Monitoring Options for RDS DB Instances:**

1. **Amazon CloudWatch (Default):**

   * Collects **OS metrics** (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O) **from the hypervisor layer**.
   * Less granular view of resource usage.
   * CPU utilization values might differ from actual usage by processes.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring (Optional – More Detailed):**

   * Collects **real-time OS metrics** **from an agent on the RDS instance itself**.
   * Offers **per-process/thread metrics** and **granular visibility** into DB performance.
   * **JSON output** is available in **CloudWatch Logs** under the `RDSOSMetrics` log group.
   * **Retention**: By default, metrics are stored for **30 days**, but this can be changed in CloudWatch settings.

---

#### 🔍 **Differences Between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring:**

| Feature                  | CloudWatch                                 | Enhanced Monitoring              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Metric Source**        | Hypervisor                                 | RDS agent inside the DB instance |
| **Granularity**          | Instance-level                             | Process/thread-level             |
| **Accuracy (CPU, etc.)** | Approximate (includes hypervisor overhead) | More accurate and detailed       |
| **Latency**              | \~1 minute                                 | \~1–5 seconds                    |
| **Customization**        | Limited                                    | High                             |

---

#### ⚠️ **Additional Considerations:**

* Differences are **more pronounced in smaller instance classes**, where **hypervisor overhead** impacts metrics more.
* For **in-depth diagnostics** (e.g., CPU usage per thread), **Enhanced Monitoring is essential**.
* To **change retention**, update the `RDSOSMetrics` **log group settings in CloudWatch**.

### 📝 **Default Termination Policy in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**

The **default termination policy** is designed to **maintain high availability and optimize cost** by distributing instances **evenly across Availability Zones (AZs)** and **terminating instances wisely** when scaling in.

---

### 🔁 **Default Termination Policy – Step-by-Step Behavior:**

1. **Choose an Availability Zone (AZ):**

   * Identify AZs with **the most instances**.
   * **Exclude** instances protected from scale-in.
   * If multiple AZs qualify:

     * Choose the one with instances using the **oldest launch template or configuration**.

2. **Filter Instances:**

   * From the selected AZ, **filter unprotected instances** using the **oldest launch template**.

3. **Billing Hour Optimization:**

   * Among the filtered instances, choose the one **closest to the next billing hour**.
   * This step helps **maximize usage** before incurring a new billing hour.

4. **Final Selection:**

   * If multiple instances are equally close to the next billing hour:

     * **Select one at random** for termination.

---

### 🎯 **Key Goals of the Default Termination Policy:**

* Maintain **even distribution** across Availability Zones.
* Favor **older launch templates** for termination (to phase out old configurations).
* **Avoid early termination** to **maximize EC2 billing efficiency**.
* Use **random selection** only as a last resort to avoid bias.

---

---

### 🛡️ **AWS Security Groups – Key Concepts**

#### 🔸 What is a Security Group?

* A **virtual firewall** for EC2 instances to **control inbound and outbound traffic**.
* Acts **at the instance level**, **not at the subnet level**.
* Each instance can be associated with **up to five** security groups.

---

### 🚪 **Inbound and Outbound Rules**

* You can **specify rules based on protocol, port number, and source/destination IP range**.
* **/32 CIDR** notation is used to **allow a single IP address** (e.g., `203.0.113.7/32`).
* **SSH** (Secure Shell) uses:

  * **Protocol:** TCP
  * **Port:** 22
  * **Usage:** Secure remote login.

---

### 🔁 **Stateful Behavior of Security Groups**

* **Security groups are stateful**, meaning:

  * If you allow **inbound traffic**, **return traffic is automatically allowed**, even without an explicit outbound rule.
  * This simplifies configuration for protocols like SSH.

---

### ✅ **Example Scenario: Allowing a Single IP for SSH**

* **Goal:** Allow only **one specific client IP** to SSH into the EC2 instance.
* **Action:**

  * Create a **security group** with an **inbound rule**:

    * **Protocol:** TCP
    * **Port:** 22
    * **Source:** `X.X.X.X/32` (client’s IP)

Here are concise notes about **Partition Key Design and Provisioned Throughput in DynamoDB**:

---

### Partition Key and Throughput in DynamoDB – Key Points

* **Partition key** determines the **logical partitions** of a table’s data.
* Logical partitions map to **physical partitions**.
* **Provisioned I/O capacity** is **evenly divided among physical partitions**.
* Poor partition key design causing **uneven I/O distribution** leads to **"hot" partitions**.
* Hot partitions cause **throttling** and inefficient use of provisioned throughput.
* Optimal throughput usage depends on:

  * **Workload patterns** (access frequency of items).
  * **Partition key design** (distribution of accessed partition key values).
* You **do not need to access all partition keys** for efficiency.
* Efficiency improves as the **ratio of distinct partition key values accessed** to the **total partition keys increases**.
* More distinct partition key values accessed → more even spread of requests → better throughput utilization.

---
Here are the notes summarizing the key points about **Amazon Aurora endpoints and load balancing**:

---

### Amazon Aurora Endpoints – Key Points

* Aurora clusters consist of multiple DB instances, not a single instance.
* Connections use **endpoints** that abstract underlying instance hostnames.
* Endpoints handle **load balancing** and **failover** automatically.
* Types of endpoints:

  * **Primary endpoint**: Connects to the primary instance for DDL and DML operations (read-write).
  * **Reader endpoint**: Connects to all Aurora Replicas for read-only queries, with automatic load balancing.
  * **Custom endpoints**: Connect to a subset of instances based on specific criteria (e.g., instance class, parameter group).

---

### Use Case for Custom Endpoints

* Separate production traffic and reporting queries by:

  * Creating a **custom endpoint** for production workloads targeting high-capacity instances.
  * Creating another **custom endpoint** for reporting queries directed at lower-capacity instances.
* Custom endpoints allow **fine-grained control** over which instances serve which workloads.
* Enables **optimized resource usage** and improved performance isolation.

---

### Summary

* Use **custom endpoints** to route traffic based on instance capacity or configuration.
* This removes the need to hardcode hostnames or implement your own load balancing logic.

---
Here are the **notes** summarizing the key concepts and solution:

* Cold starts happen on first invocation, but **concurrent invocations** are handled by **provisioning more instances**
* **Initial burst concurrency**: 500–3000 per Region (depending on Region)

---

### 🚀 **Why Lambda for Burst Handling?**

* Scales **within seconds**, faster than launching EC2 instances
* Cost-efficient: **Pay only for execution time**
* AWS handles:

  * Provisioning
  * Scaling
  * High availability
* Supports **event-driven** and **on-demand** architectures

---

### 🏗️ **Architecture Flow**

> **Create an API using Amazon API Gateway** and **use AWS Lambda** to handle bursts of traffic efficiently and cost-effectively.

---
Great question! Let's break it down clearly:

---

## ✅ **When to Use Signed Cookies vs Signed URLs**

### 🧾 **Signed Cookies**

Use **Signed Cookies** when:

* You want to **restrict access to multiple files** (e.g., all video chunks in HLS/DASH streaming or a group of documents).
* You **don’t want to modify URLs** (e.g., existing pages or resources stay untouched).
* Your users **access content via browsers** (that support cookies).
* You want a **smoother user experience** — users get access once and all authorized resources are accessible without needing a new signed URL for each.

🟢 Example Use Cases:

* Video-on-demand platforms (accessing playlists and media segments)
* Member-only portals (subscribers’ area of a site)

---

### 🔗 **Signed URLs**

Use **Signed URLs** when:

* You want to **restrict access to individual files** (e.g., one-time software download).
* You’re using a **custom HTTP client or a client that doesn't support cookies**.
* You're distributing **RTMP content** (CloudFront RTMP distributions only support signed URLs).
* You want **more granular access control** — per-file, per-request, etc.

🟢 Example Use Cases:

* License-protected software downloads
* Temporary download links
* Secure access via mobile apps or IoT clients

---

## 🔐 **When to Use Field-Level Encryption**

Use **Field-Level Encryption** when:

* You want to **protect sensitive user data** in HTTP POST requests that go through CloudFront.
* The data includes things like **credit card numbers, personally identifiable information (PII)**, etc.
* You want **only your origin application to decrypt** certain fields, while CloudFront and intermediate services **cannot see** them.

🛡️ It uses **public-key encryption**, where:

* You configure CloudFront with your **public key** to encrypt specific fields.
* Only your origin (with the **private key**) can decrypt them.

   * ✅ **Action:**
     Create and attach an **SCP** to the **root OU** that **denies `ec2:CreateVolume`** if **`ec2:Encrypted` is false**.
   * ✅ **Example SCP Condition:**

     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedEBSVolumes",
           "Effect": "Deny",
           "Action": "ec2:CreateVolume",
           "Resource": "*",
           "Condition": {
             "BoolIfExists": {
               "ec2:Encrypted": "false"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   * ✅ **Effect:**
     Prevents creation of **unencrypted** EBS volumes, even if attempted manually.

Here are the **key notes** regarding the **cooldown period in Auto Scaling**:

---

## 🕒 **Auto Scaling Cooldown Period – Key Points**

1. ✅ **Prevents overlapping actions**

   * The **cooldown period** ensures that an Auto Scaling group **does not launch or terminate** additional EC2 instances **before the previous scaling activity is complete** and the system has stabilized.
   * This prevents **unnecessary scaling** and helps avoid **resource thrashing**.

2. ✅ **Default value is 300 seconds**

   * By default, the cooldown period is **300 seconds (5 minutes)** after a scaling activity.
   * During this time, Auto Scaling **pauses further scaling actions** to allow metrics to stabilize.

3. ✅ **Configurable**

   * The cooldown period is **configurable** at both:

     * The **Auto Scaling group level** (applies to all policies unless overridden).
     * The **scaling policy level** (can override the default cooldown with a policy-specific cooldown).

You're absolutely right in your explanation, and here's a concise summary and reasoning for the scenario:

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

**Set up a new IPv4 subnet with a larger CIDR range. Associate the new subnet with the VPC and then launch the instance.**

---

### 💡 **Explanation:**

* **Amazon VPC** allows you to define a virtual network using an IPv4 CIDR block.
* When you **create a subnet**, it must be a subset of the VPC's CIDR block.
* Each subnet is bound to a **single Availability Zone** and has a **fixed range of IPs**.
* If you've run out of available IPv4 addresses in a subnet (which is common if the CIDR range is too small), you won’t be able to launch new EC2 instances in that subnet.

---

### 🔧 **Fix:**

You need to:

1. **Create a new subnet** with a **larger IPv4 CIDR block** (e.g., `/24` instead of `/28`).
2. Ensure it's associated with the correct **VPC** and **Availability Zone** if needed.
3. **Launch the EC2 instance** in the newly created subnet.

---

### 🧠 Notes:

* You **cannot modify** the CIDR block of an existing subnet.
* While **dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)** is supported, most AWS services and VPC-level operations **require IPv4**, so you **cannot rely solely on IPv6**.

---
Here's a concise set of **notes** summarizing your information about VPN connectivity in Amazon VPC:

---

### 🛡️ **Amazon VPC VPN Connectivity – Key Notes**

* **Default Behavior:**
  Instances launched in a VPC **cannot communicate with on-premises networks** by default.

* **Enable Access to On-Premises Network:**
  To enable VPN connectivity from a VPC to your network:

  1. Attach a **Virtual Private Gateway** (VGW) to your VPC.
  2. Create a **custom route table** to route traffic to the VGW.
  3. Update **Security Group** and **Network ACL** rules to allow desired traffic.
  4. Set up an **AWS-managed VPN connection**.

* **VPN Connection (in AWS terminology):**
  A **VPN connection** refers to the **IPsec connection between the AWS VPC and your on-premises network**.

* **Customer Gateway (CGW):**

  * A **physical device** or **software appliance** on the customer (your) side of the VPN.
  * You must **create a CGW resource in AWS**, which includes:

    * The **static, internet-routable IP address** of the CGW device.
    * Optional BGP ASN for dynamic routing (if using BGP).

* **VPN Architecture:**

  * **Virtual Private Gateway** (VGW) is attached to the VPC.
  * **Customer Gateway** (CGW) is your on-premises device.
  * The VPN connection is established between VGW and CGW using IPsec.

* **Routing:**

  * Route VPC-bound traffic to the **VGW**.
  * Ensure the **on-premises router** is configured to accept and route traffic back to the VPC.

Here are **concise notes** on the **Bastion Host in AWS**:

---

### 🔐 **Bastion Host – Key Concepts in AWS**

* **Purpose:**
  A **bastion host** is a hardened EC2 instance used to securely access **instances in private subnets**.

* **Placement:**

  * Launched in a **public subnet** of your **VPC**.
  * Assigned a **public IP or Elastic IP**.

* **Access Configuration:**

  * Security Group must allow:

    * **SSH (port 22)** for Linux or
    * **RDP (port 3389)** for Windows,
    * **From trusted IP ranges** (e.g., your office or admin IP).
  * Acts as a **jump server** to access private instances using private IPs.

* **Usage Workflow:**

  1. Connect to the **bastion host** from your local machine.
  2. From the bastion, **SSH or RDP** into **private EC2 instances**.
  3. No need to expose private instances directly to the internet.

* **Security Best Practices:**

  * Use **multi-factor authentication** and **key pairs**.
  * Enable **logging (CloudWatch Logs, Session Manager)**.
  * Consider replacing it with **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** for improved security (no public IP needed).

Here are the notes on prerequisites for routing traffic using Route 53 to an S3-hosted static website:

---

### 📝 **Notes: Routing Route 53 to S3 Static Website**

* ✅ **S3 Bucket Name Requirement**

  * The S3 bucket **must have the same name as the domain name** (e.g., `example.com` or `www.example.com`) for Route 53 to route traffic correctly.

* ✅ **Domain Name Requirement**

  * A **registered domain name** is required (can be registered via Route 53 or another domain registrar).

* ❌ **CORS Not Required**

  * **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** does not need to be enabled for simple static website hosting.


* ❌ **Region Irrelevance**

  * The **S3 bucket and Route 53 hosted zone do not need to be in the same region**. Route 53 is a global service.

Here are the summarized notes on **AWS Tags and Cost Allocation**:

---

### 📝 **Notes: AWS Tags and Cost Allocation**

* ✅ **Definition of a Tag**

  * A **tag** is a label assigned to an AWS resource.
  * Each tag is a **key-value pair**.
  * **Each tag key must be unique** per resource and can have **only one value**.

* ✅ **Purpose of Tags**

  * Used to **organize resources** (e.g., by environment, owner, project).
  * Help in **resource management, automation, and access control**.

* ✅ **Cost Allocation Tags**

  * Tags can be activated in the **Billing and Cost Management Console**.
  * Once activated, AWS generates **cost allocation reports** in **CSV format**.
  * Reports include **usage and cost details grouped by active tags**.

* ✅ **Business Categorization**

  * Common tag keys include:

    * `CostCenter`
    * `Environment`
    * `Application`
    * `Owner`

* ✅ **Usage Across Services**

  * Tags can be applied to **many AWS services** (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda).

### 📝 **Notes: Network Load Balancer (NLB) & Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)**

#### ✅ **Network Load Balancer (NLB) Overview**

* Operates at **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** of the **OSI model**.
* Capable of handling **millions of requests per second**.
* Uses **TCP connections** to route traffic to targets.
* After receiving a connection request, it selects a target from the **default rule’s target group**.
* Attempts to open a **TCP connection** on the **port defined in the listener configuration**.

#### ✅ **Using NLB with Trusted IPs**

* Some clients only allow access to **whitelisted or trusted IPs**.
* Using standard NLB **Elastic IPs (EIPs)** might require **updating client firewalls**, which can be cumbersome.

#### ✅ **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)**

* Allows you to bring **your own public IP addresses** into AWS.
* You can then **assign these IPs as Elastic IPs** to services like the **Network Load Balancer**.
* Benefits:

  * Continue using **already trusted IP addresses**.
  * Avoid the need to **re-establish whitelists**.
  * Simplifies **migration and integration** with legacy systems.

### 📝 **Notes: Using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) for High Availability**

#### ✅ **Purpose**

* Use **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** to rapidly recover critical services when an EC2 instance fails.

#### ✅ **How It Works**

* Assign a **secondary ENI** (Elastic Network Interface) to your **primary EC2 instance**.
* The ENI retains:

  * **Private IP addresses**
  * **Elastic IP addresses (if associated)**
  * **MAC address**
* If the instance fails:

  * Detach the ENI from the failed instance.
  * **Attach it to a hot standby instance** that is pre-configured.
  * **Network traffic resumes** with minimal disruption.

#### ✅ **Benefits**

* **Fast failover**: No need to update DNS or route tables.
* **Consistent IP/MAC**: Applications and systems continue to recognize the network interface.
* **Minimal downtime**: Only a brief connectivity loss during the ENI switch.

#### ✅ **Correct Approach**

> **Create a secondary Elastic Network Interface (ENI), attach it to the primary instance, and point your application’s domain to the ENI’s private IPv4 address. If the instance fails, move the ENI to a pre-configured standby instance.**

Here are concise notes summarizing the use of **Application Load Balancers (ALBs) with gRPC**:

---

### 📝 **Notes: ALB Support for gRPC**

#### ✅ **Overview**

* **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)** now support **gRPC**, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
* This allows routing and load balancing of **gRPC traffic** between:

  * Microservices
  * gRPC-enabled clients and backend services

#### ✅ **Features**

* **Path-based routing**: Direct traffic based on the URL path.
* **Host-based routing**: Route requests based on the hostname (domain).
* **Bi-directional streaming**: Supports **full-duplex communication** via gRPC.
* **No client/server changes** required to enable gRPC routing—works seamlessly with existing infrastructure.

#### ✅ **Benefits**

* Easier **gRPC traffic management** in modern microservice architectures.
* Enables **fine-grained routing logic** for gRPC workloads.
* ALB still handles:

  * SSL termination
  * Health checks
  * Security group integration
  * Monitoring and logging

💡 **Use Case**: Perfect for **microservices** architecture where services communicate via **gRPC**, and centralized routing control via ALB is desired.

### 📝 **Notes: Using Amazon CloudWatch with Amazon SNS for Notifications**

#### ✅ **Purpose**

* **Amazon CloudWatch** is used to monitor AWS resources (e.g., EC2, RDS) by collecting logs, metrics, and events.
* **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)** is used to **send notifications** (like emails, SMS, etc.) when CloudWatch alarms are triggered.

#### ✅ **Key Points**

* **CloudWatch** provides a **unified view** of operational data for AWS and on-premises resources.
* Use **SNS** to **notify teams** (e.g., Operations team) via email, SMS, or other endpoints when specific thresholds are breached (like CPU usage, DB errors, etc.).
* **SES (Simple Email Service)** is designed for:

  * **Transactional email**
  * **Marketing campaigns**
  * **Bulk email sending**
* SES is **not suitable** for infrastructure or system alerting purposes.

#### ✅ **Recommended Setup**

1. Create a **CloudWatch Alarm** based on a metric (e.g., CPUUtilization > 80%).
2. Set the **alarm action** to publish a message to an **SNS topic**.
3. Subscribe team emails or endpoints to that **SNS topic**.

💡 **Use Case**: Automatically notify DevOps or IT teams when system thresholds are crossed — ensuring proactive issue response.

### ✅ **Creating a New Aurora MySQL DB Instance from Backups – Notes**

**Scenario Summary:**

* A MySQL RDS DB instance was used for testing.
* Two types of backups were created:

  * **Logical backup** using `mysqldump`
  * **Physical snapshot** using final DB snapshot during RDS termination
* Goal: Restore into **Amazon Aurora MySQL-compatible edition**

---

### 🔹 **Valid Restore Options:**

1. **Using `mysqldump` backup:**

   * ✅ **Upload the database dump to Amazon S3.**
   * ✅ **Option 1:** Use Aurora MySQL’s **native S3 integration** to import the dump.
   * ✅ **Option 2:** Use **AWS DMS** (Database Migration Service) to import the dump from S3 into Aurora.

2. **Using final RDS snapshot:**

   * ❌ **Not directly usable with Aurora**
   * RDS and Aurora use different snapshot formats.
   * RDS snapshots cannot be **imported into Aurora** directly.

---

### 🔹 **Incorrect Methods:**

* ❌ **Importing RDS snapshot into Aurora directly** – Not supported.
* ❌ **Uploading RDS snapshot to S3** – Not possible.
* ❌ **Using AWS DMS with RDS snapshot** – DMS does not read snapshots, only live databases or files in S3.

---

### ✅ **Correct Answers:**

* **C:** Upload the database dump to Amazon S3 and import into Aurora.
* **E:** Upload the database dump to Amazon S3 and use AWS DMS to import into Aurora.

---

Here’s a clear and concise comparison between **Snapshots** and **Dumps** in the context of databases, particularly Amazon RDS and MySQL:

---

### ✅ **Snapshots vs Dumps – Comparison Table**

| Feature                       | **Snapshot**                                         | **Dump (e.g., `mysqldump`)**                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                      | Physical backup                                      | Logical backup                                    |
| **Format**                    | Binary image of the database instance                | Text file with SQL statements                     |
| **Speed (Backup/Restore)**    | Fast                                                 | Slower, especially for large databases            |
| **Granularity**               | Full instance or full database                       | Full or partial (can export specific tables/data) |
| **Portability**               | Limited (RDS snapshots only work in RDS, not Aurora) | High (can restore to any MySQL-compatible system) |
| **Storage Location**          | Amazon RDS-managed storage                           | User-defined (e.g., local machine or Amazon S3)   |
| **Automation Support**        | Supports automated snapshots                         | Manual (or script-based)                          |
| **Use Cases**                 | Fast restore to same or similar environment          | Data migration, cross-platform restore            |
| **Compatibility with Aurora** | ❌ Not directly usable                                | ✅ Can be imported                                 |
| **Dependencies**              | RDS service specific                                 | Just requires MySQL engine                        |

---

### 📌 **When to Use Snapshots**

* For quick restoration of the entire RDS instance in case of failure.
* For cloning RDS instances in the same service or region.
* For short-term backup and rollback during updates.

---

### 📌 **When to Use Dumps**

* For migrating data to a different DB engine (e.g., RDS MySQL → Aurora).
* For long-term archival of schema and data.
* For exporting specific tables or partial data.

Here are the **notes** for the AWS Budgets + Organizations scenario:

---

### 📘 **AWS Budgets with AWS Organizations – Notes**

#### 🔹 **Objective:**

* Set individual budgets for AWS accounts within an Organization.
* Receive alerts when thresholds are met.
* Prevent further resource provisioning after the budget is exceeded.

---

### ✅ **Key Components & Steps:**

1. **AWS Budgets Setup**

   * Use the **Billing Dashboard** in each AWS account to create and manage **budgets**.
   * Define budget types: **Cost**, **Usage**, **RI Coverage**, etc.

2. **IAM Role for Budget Actions**

   * Create an **IAM role** that AWS Budgets can assume.
   * This role must have permissions to enforce actions like attaching SCPs or modifying permissions.

3. **Budget Alerts & Actions**

   * Configure **alerts** via Amazon SNS when thresholds are crossed.
   * Create **budget actions**:

     * Choose the IAM role (not a user) created earlier.
     * Use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to restrict provisioning once the budget is hit.

---

### ❗ **Important Considerations:**

* SCPs are enforced at the **organization level** and can be used to block specific API actions (like EC2\:RunInstances).
* IAM users cannot be used to run budget actions—**only IAM roles** are supported.
* AWS Config is not used for enforcing budget limits—**Config Rules are for compliance**, not budgeting.

---

### 🟩 **Correct Answers Recap (From Multiple Choice):**

* **B.** Use AWS Budgets from Billing Dashboard.
* **D.** Create an IAM **role** for AWS Budgets.
* **F.** Add alert and use **SCP** for provisioning block after threshold.

---
Here are the **notes** for the given scenario:

### 📘 **RDS PostgreSQL – High Availability Without Application Code Changes**

#### ❓ **Scenario Overview:**

* The application uses an **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL** (Single-AZ).
* The goal is to **eliminate single points of failure** and **minimize database downtime**.
* **No changes to application code** are allowed.

---

### ✅ **Correct Solution:**

> **A. Convert the existing database instance to a Multi-AZ deployment by modifying the database instance and specifying the Multi-AZ option.**

#### 🔹 Why A is Correct:

* **Multi-AZ deployments** provide high availability by automatically replicating data synchronously to a standby instance in another **Availability Zone (AZ)**.
* Failover is automatic and **requires no changes to application code**.
* This **minimizes downtime** during maintenance, AZ outages, or instance failure.

---

### ❌ **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**

* **B.** Creating a new Multi-AZ deployment and restoring from a snapshot requires **manual intervention**, and may cause **more downtime**.

* **C.** Read replicas are **read-only** and **do not support automatic failover**. Also, **Route 53 cannot distinguish read/write logic**—this requires app code changes.

* **D.** RDS cannot be placed in an **EC2 Auto Scaling group**. This option is invalid and not applicable for RDS instances.

---

### 🟩 **Summary:**

* **Use Multi-AZ deployment** to eliminate single points of failure in RDS.
* It ensures **automatic failover** and **minimal downtime**.
* **No application changes are required**.

---
Here are **notes** for this scenario:

---

### 📘 **EC2 Nitro-Based Instances + Simultaneous EBS Access**

#### ❓ **Scenario Overview:**

* The application runs on **multiple EC2 Nitro-based instances** in the **same Availability Zone**.
* The app must **write to multiple block storage volumes simultaneously** from multiple instances.
* Goal: **Higher availability and concurrent access to block storage.**

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

> **C. Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) EBS volumes with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach**

---

### 🔹 **Why C is Correct:**

* **EBS Multi-Attach** allows **io1 and io2** volumes to be **attached to multiple EC2 instances at the same time**.
* Only **Nitro-based instances** support Multi-Attach.
* **io2 volumes** offer:

  * High performance and low latency.
  * **Support for Multi-Attach**, enabling simultaneous read/write access.
  * Suitable for highly available clustered applications (e.g., databases, clustered file systems).

---

### ❌ **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

| Option     | Reason It's Incorrect                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. gp3** | **Multi-Attach not supported** on gp3 volumes.                                                     |
| **B. st1** | HDD volumes like **st1** do not support Multi-Attach and are not suitable for simultaneous writes. |
| **D. gp2** | Like gp3, **gp2 also does not support Multi-Attach**.                                              |

---

### 🟩 **Summary:**

* Use **EBS Multi-Attach with io2 volumes** to enable concurrent write access from multiple Nitro-based instances.
* This solution is ideal for **high-availability clustered applications** that need shared block storage.

---
Here are **notes** for the given scenario:

### 📘 **AWS Organizations & Compute Savings Plan Utilization**

#### ❓ **Scenario Summary:**

* A member account **purchased a Compute Savings Plan**.
* Due to workload changes, the **member account is only using <50%** of the committed compute.
* Goal: **Maximize utilization** of the existing Savings Plan.

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

> **B. Turn on discount sharing from the Billing Preferences section of the account console in the company's Organizations management account.**

---

### 🟢 **Why Option B is Correct:**

* **Savings Plans support sharing across accounts** within the same AWS Organization.
* However, **discount sharing must be enabled from the management account** (not from the member account).
* Once enabled, **unused Savings Plan discounts** from one account can be **applied to other accounts' usage** within the organization.

---

### ❌ **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

| Option | Reason                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A.** | **Discount sharing cannot be enabled from a member account.** Must be done from the **management account**. |
| **C.** | Migrating workloads manually is inefficient and **not scalable**. Sharing is the intended feature.          |
| **D.** | **Savings Plans are not resellable**. Only **Reserved Instances** can be sold on the RI Marketplace.        |

---

### 🟩 **Summary:**

* **Compute Savings Plans** offer **flexibility across instance families and regions**.
* To optimize underutilized Savings Plans, **enable discount sharing from the management account** in AWS Organizations.
* This ensures **unused capacity can benefit other member accounts** automatically.
---

### ✅ Correct Answer:

**B. Design a REST API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a private VPC link for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS.**

---

### 📘 **Explanation:**

#### 🔹 **Requirements Recap:**

* Expose **REST APIs** to the frontend.
* Access **backend microservices hosted in ECS (containers)**.
* ECS containers are running in **private VPC subnets**.
* Must allow **secure communication between API Gateway and ECS**.

---

### 🧩 **Why Option B is Correct:**

* **REST API** is explicitly required (WebSocket is for bidirectional, real-time communication — not suitable here).
* **Amazon API Gateway** REST APIs cannot directly reach into private VPCs.
* So, you **must use a VPC Link** (via **PrivateLink**) to access services in private subnets.
* ECS containers are in private subnets, so **Private VPC Link is needed to securely connect** API Gateway to ECS.

---

### ❌ Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

| Option | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**  | Uses **WebSocket API**, which is not required. Also otherwise similar to B, but not appropriate due to API type.                                                                      |
| **C**  | Again, **WebSocket** is incorrect. Plus, **security groups alone won't allow API Gateway to access private ECS** — VPC Link is needed.                                                |
| **D**  | REST API is correct, but **security group is not sufficient**. API Gateway needs **VPC Link to access private ECS** services — cannot just assign a security group to bridge the gap. |

---

### 📝 **Summary:**

* Use **REST APIs** with **Amazon API Gateway**.
* To **access private ECS services**, use **Private VPC Link (powered by AWS PrivateLink)**.
* This ensures **secure, scalable integration** between your API frontend and backend services in a private VPC.
---
### ✅ Correct Answer:

**Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.**

---

### 📘 **Explanation:**

#### 🔹 **Key Requirements:**

* Apply **third-party software patches** (not OS-level patches).
* Affects **1,000 EC2 Linux instances**.
* Needs to be done **as quickly as possible**.
* The goal is to **remediate a critical vulnerability**.

---

### 🧩 **Why “Run Command” is Best:**

* **AWS Systems Manager Run Command** allows you to **execute custom scripts or commands** across many instances **in parallel**, **immediately**, without any additional setup like maintenance windows.
* It's the best option for **ad-hoc or emergency fixes**, especially when patching **non-OS third-party software**.
* Supports auditing via **AWS CloudTrail** and **SSM logs**.

---

### ❌ Why the Other Options Are Not Best:

| Option                     | Reason it's not suitable                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Lambda**             | Cannot directly access EC2 internals unless combined with SSM and more logic. Not scalable or reliable for this use case. |
| **SSM Patch Manager**      | Targets **operating system patches**, not third-party software. Not suitable here.                                        |
| **SSM Maintenance Window** | Adds unnecessary **delay and complexity**; designed for **scheduled** updates, not **emergency** fixes.                   |

---

### 📝 Summary:

* **Use SSM Run Command** for fast, secure, and parallel execution of custom patching scripts across EC2.
* Make sure the EC2 instances have **SSM Agent installed and IAM roles configured**.

Here are **notes** based on your statement about **Route 53 health checks and failover configurations**:

---

### 📘 **Amazon Route 53 Failover and Health Checks – Key Notes**

#### ✅ **Health Checks Overview**

* Route 53 **health checks** monitor the health and availability of resources such as:

  * Web servers
  * Load balancers
  * Other endpoints (IP or domain)

#### 🔁 **Failover Configurations**

##### 1. **Active-Active Failover**

* **Goal**: Route traffic to **multiple healthy endpoints simultaneously**.
* **Routing Policies Used**:

  * **Weighted**
  * **Latency**
  * **Geolocation**
  * **Geoproximity**
  * **Multivalue answer**
* **Health checks** are attached to all records.
* Route 53 only returns healthy endpoints in DNS responses.
* **Traffic is balanced** across all healthy resources.

##### 2. **Active-Passive Failover**

* **Goal**: Use a **primary (active)** resource and a **standby (passive)** resource.
* **Routing Policy Used**: **Failover routing policy**
* Configure two records:

  * One for **primary** with `type: PRIMARY`
  * One for **secondary** with `type: SECONDARY`
* Health check is associated with the **primary**.
* If the primary fails, Route 53 routes traffic to the **secondary**.

---

### 🧠 Pro Tips:

* Health checks can monitor:

  * HTTP/HTTPS/TCP endpoints
  * CloudWatch alarms
* You can optionally set health checks to monitor other health checks (calculated health checks).
* DNS TTL values impact how quickly clients react to failover changes.

---

Here are your **notes and overall explanation** for this CloudFormation scenario:

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

**Configure a `CreationPolicy` attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured using the `cfn-signal` helper script.**

---

### 📘 **Concept Breakdown:**

#### 🛠️ **Use Case:**

You are deploying a **complex, multi-tier architecture** (Active Directory, SQL Server, EC2 instances running SharePoint, etc.) using **AWS CloudFormation**, and you want the stack creation to **wait** until each component is properly **installed and configured** before moving forward.

---

### ⚙️ **Key CloudFormation Features Involved:**

#### 1. **CreationPolicy**

* Applied to **AWS::EC2::Instance** or **Auto Scaling Group** resources.
* **Pauses stack creation** until:

  * You explicitly **send a success signal** from inside the instance using the `cfn-signal` tool.
* Helps **ensure configuration is complete** (e.g., software is installed via `cfn-init`, services are running, etc.).
* Prevents CloudFormation from marking the resource as `CREATE_COMPLETE` prematurely.

##### ✅ Example:

```yaml
Resources:
  SharePointServer:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init: {...}
    CreationPolicy:
      ResourceSignal:
        Timeout: PT30M
    UserData:
      Fn::Base64: !Sub |
        #!/bin/bash
        /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init ...
        /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal --exit-code $? ...
```

#### 2. **cfn-signal**

* Command-line utility used to **send success or failure signals** to CloudFormation from within an instance.
* Signals that the instance is **ready and healthy**.

---

### ❌ **Incorrect Options Explained:**

#### A. **DependsOn with `cfn-init`**

* `DependsOn` **controls logical order** of resource creation, **not readiness or completion** of internal setup.
* It won’t wait for software configuration to finish.

#### B. **UpdatePolicy with `cfn-signal`**

* `UpdatePolicy` applies to **Auto Scaling Groups** during **updates**, not initial creation.
* Not appropriate for standalone EC2 instances or initial configuration steps.

#### C. **UpdateReplacePolicy with `cfn-signal`**

* This controls **what happens to the old resource during a replacement** (e.g., retain, delete, snapshot).
* It is **unrelated** to stack creation flow or readiness signaling.

The correct answer is:

> ✅ **Migrate the application to an EC2 instance with hibernation enabled.**

---

### 🧠 **Explanation:**

The question revolves around **reducing boot time** for a Windows EC2 instance **without increasing cost**, while retaining the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

---

### 💡 Why **EC2 Hibernation**?

EC2 **hibernation** allows you to pause your instance and resume it faster than a full reboot by:

* Saving the contents of the **RAM to the EBS root volume**.
* On resume, the instance **restores from memory**, skipping the OS boot and application startup processes.

This significantly **reduces startup time**—just like waking up your laptop from sleep instead of rebooting it.

It also:

* **Retains application state**.
* Does **not charge for EC2 compute** while stopped.
* Only incurs **storage costs** for the root and RAM snapshot volumes.

Perfect for your use case where the instance needs to:

* Be **stopped during off-hours** to save costs.
* **Start quickly** when needed.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are incorrect:

#### ❌ **Enable the hibernation mode on the EC2 instance** (your original answer)

* Sounds correct, but **you must **first** migrate the instance to one that supports hibernation.**
* Not all instance types, AMIs, or volumes support hibernation out of the box.
* Hibernation **requires specific configurations**, such as:

  * **Instance types**: Must support hibernation (e.g., C5, M5, T3).
  * **Root volume**: Must be **EBS-backed** and encrypted.
  * **Instance size**: Less than 150 GB RAM.

So this answer is **partially right**, but incomplete. That’s why the correct option is the **migration to an instance that supports hibernation**.

---

#### ❌ **Disable the Instance Metadata Service**

* IMDS has **minimal impact on startup time**.
* Disabling it could break essential services like SSM, instance role retrieval, etc.

#### ❌ **Migrate the application to a Linux-based EC2 instance**

* Moving to Linux might reduce cost, but it **doesn't directly address the boot time issue**.
* Also, may require **rewriting or reconfiguring** the application — **not cost-effective or quick**.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Option                                                  | Verdict | Reason                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable hibernation on the existing instance             | ❌       | Not all instances support it; need migration/config change |

| Migrate to Linux                                        | ❌       | Doesn't help with startup time and may break app           |
| **Migrate to an EC2 instance with hibernation enabled** | ✅       | Allows quick resume, low cost, retains state               |

The **most cost-effective** solution that meets the requirements is:

> ✅ **Store the values by creating SecureString type parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for the encryption. Update the application to retrieve the parameter values.**

---

### 🧠 **Explanation:**

You need to:

* Store **application variables** (like DB hostnames, passwords, keys) securely.
* Use **encryption at rest**.
* Have a **cost-effective** and **secure** solution.

---

### ✅ **Why AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with SecureString is the best choice:**

* **SecureString parameters** allow you to **encrypt sensitive data** using **AWS KMS**.
* You can **control access** using IAM policies.
* It integrates **natively with EC2, Lambda, and other AWS services**.
* You can retrieve parameters at **runtime** via SDK, CLI, or SSM Agent.
* **Free tier**: Parameter Store provides **free storage and access** for standard parameters (with limits), and **costs less** than AWS Secrets Manager for most workloads.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are less optimal:

#### **1. AWS Secrets Manager**

* ✅ Secure and good for credentials.
* ❌ **More expensive** than Parameter Store (e.g., \$0.40 per secret per month + API call charges).
* **Best for dynamic secrets** like database credentials that rotate.
* **Overkill** if you're just storing static configuration values.

#### **2. AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter**

* ❌ **Not meant for storing application configuration or secrets**.
* It’s for tracking and resolving operational issues.
* Not a key-value store for app configs.

#### **3. Amazon S3 (with encryption)**

* ❌ Requires **managing your own logic** to parse and load secrets.
* ❌ Managing encryption, permissions, and retrieval manually is **less secure** and **more error-prone**.
* ❌ Not as fine-grained as Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

---

### ✅ Summary Table:

| Option                             | Secure      | Encrypted    | Cost-effective | Purpose-built                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Parameter Store (SecureString)** | ✅           | ✅ (with KMS) | ✅              | ✅                             |
| Secrets Manager                    | ✅           | ✅            | ❌              | ✅ (best for rotating secrets) |
| OpsCenter                          | ❌           | ❌            | ❌              | ❌                             |
| S3 (encrypted file)                | ⚠️ (manual) | ✅            | ⚠️ (depends)   | ❌                             |

---

### ✅ Recommendation:

Use **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with SecureString** for storing encrypted configuration values — it’s secure, cost-effective, and well-suited for your use case.

---
The **most cost-effective and scalable solution** in this case is:

> ✅ **Upload all SSL certificates of the domains in the ALB using the console and bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client using Server Name Indication (SNI).**

---

### 🧠 **Explanation:**

You have:

* Multiple **distinct domain names** (not subdomains).
* An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
* A requirement to serve **HTTPS** for better SEO and security.
* A need for **cost-effective** scaling as domains grow.

---

### ✅ Why the correct answer is best:

* **ALB supports SNI (Server Name Indication)**: This allows a single secure listener to handle multiple SSL certificates and domain names **without requiring a dedicated IP per domain**.
* **No need to reauthenticate/reprovision certificates** when adding new domains: Just upload the new cert and bind it to the existing ALB listener.
* **Cost-effective**: You avoid needing extra Load Balancers or CloudFront distributions for each domain.
* **Scalable**: Easily supports many different domains with separate certs.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are **not** ideal:

#### 1. **CloudFront with dedicated IPs**

* ❌ **Expensive**: Dedicated IPs for SSL in CloudFront incur high costs.
* ❌ Overkill: This option is meant for legacy clients that don’t support SNI (rare case).
* ❌ Not required unless serving content globally or needing advanced caching.

#### 2. **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**

* ❌ Hard to scale: Every time a new domain is added, the cert must be reissued with the new SAN list.
* ❌ Inflexible for frequent updates.

#### 3. **Wildcard certificate**

* ❌ Only works for **subdomains** (e.g., `*.i-love-manila.com`), **not for completely different domains** like `i-love-boracay.com`.
* ❌ Not applicable across multiple root domains.

---

### ✅ Summary Table:

| Option                             | Supports Many Domains | Scalable                | Cost-effective | Notes                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Multiple Certs with SNI on ALB** | ✅                     | ✅                       | ✅              | Best practice                  |
| CloudFront w/ Dedicated IP         | ✅                     | ⚠️                      | ❌              | Costly                         |
| SAN Cert                           | ✅                     | ❌                       | ⚠️             | Needs reissue for every domain |
| Wildcard Cert                      | ❌                     | ✅ (only for subdomains) | ✅              | Only for subdomains            |

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation:

Use **multiple certificates with ALB SNI support**. It’s **simple**, **cost-efficient**, and **designed** exactly for this use case involving many unrelated domains needing HTTPS.

To improve performance and scalability for a **high-traffic, serverless AR mobile game** using **DynamoDB and Lambda**, the **two best options** are:

---

### ✅ **1. Enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and ensure that Auto Scaling is enabled with high maximum read/write capacity**

* **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)** provides **microsecond latency** reads for DynamoDB, which is crucial for game responsiveness.
* **Auto Scaling** allows the table to adjust read/write throughput as traffic fluctuates, but **setting higher maximum limits** ensures enough headroom for sudden traffic spikes.

✅ **Benefits:**

* Ultra-low latency (from milliseconds to microseconds).
* Automatically scales to handle millions of users.
* No need to refactor the current Lambda + DynamoDB architecture.

---

### ✅ **2. Use API Gateway with Lambda and enable caching; enable DynamoDB global replication**

* **API Gateway caching** stores responses for commonly accessed data (like player profiles or leaderboards), reducing load on DynamoDB and Lambda.
* **Global tables** replicate DynamoDB data across multiple Regions for:

  * Reduced latency for global users.
  * Higher availability and resiliency.

✅ **Benefits:**

* Further reduces repeated reads to DynamoDB.
* Helps scale for a **global audience**.
* Keeps serverless design and low operational overhead.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are incorrect:

#### ❌ **Using IAM Identity Center for direct DynamoDB access**

* Not intended for millions of game clients.
* Dangerous: clients should **not access DynamoDB directly**; use Lambda or API Gateway for security and validation.

#### ❌ **Configure CloudFront with DynamoDB as origin**

* CloudFront doesn’t support DynamoDB as an origin.
* ElastiCache is not for client-side caching in mobile games.

#### ❌ **Assuming auto scaling is always enough without increasing limits**

* **Auto Scaling has max limits**; if not adjusted, it can throttle requests during sudden spikes.

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation:

For a high-read, globally accessed mobile game:

1. **Enable DAX + Auto Scaling** with a high ceiling.
2. **Use API Gateway caching + DynamoDB Global Tables** for low-latency, scalable reads across Regions.

---
To meet the requirement that **financial data must be retrievable in under 15 minutes at any time**, and support **up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput**, the **correct choices** are:

---

### ✅ **1. Use Expedited Retrieval to access the financial data**

* **Amazon S3 Glacier Expedited Retrieval** is designed for **fast access**, typically **1–5 minutes**, for small portions of data.
* It guarantees **sub-15-minute** retrieval, which matches the **compliance requirement**.
* However, **Expedited Retrievals can be throttled** if there's not enough capacity.

---

### ✅ **2. Purchase provisioned retrieval capacity**

* **Provisioned capacity** reserves retrieval throughput for **Expedited Retrievals**.
* It guarantees **retrieval availability even during high demand**, supporting **sustained throughput up to 150 MB/s**, depending on the number of capacity units purchased.
* This addresses the **requirement for retrieval at any time** under all circumstances.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are incorrect:

#### ❌ **Use Standard Retrieval**

* Standard Retrieval takes **3–5 hours** — **too slow** for the audit requirement.

#### ❌ **Use Bulk Retrieval**

* Bulk Retrieval is **even slower** (up to 12 hours) — **not suitable** for urgent compliance needs.

#### ❌ **Specify a range, or portion, of the data**

* While partial retrieval can reduce costs or retrieval time slightly, **it does not guarantee retrieval within 15 minutes**, especially without expedited mode and provisioned capacity.

---

### ✅ Summary:

To meet the **15-minute audit compliance requirement with 150 MB/s retrieval throughput**, you must:

* Use **Expedited Retrieval** ✅
* **Purchase provisioned retrieval capacity** ✅

This ensures **low-latency access and guaranteed availability**, regardless of demand or data size.
---
When an Amazon EC2 instance is **stopped and then started**, certain changes and behaviors occur, especially when using **instance store volumes** and **Elastic IP addresses**. Here's what happens in this case:

---

### ✅ **Correct: The underlying host for the instance is possibly changed**

* When an instance is stopped and started (not rebooted), **EC2 may place it on a different physical host** for maintenance or other reasons.
* This means that **any host-level data**, such as instance store, may be lost.

---

### ✅ **Correct: All data on the attached instance-store devices will be lost**

* **Instance store volumes** are **ephemeral storage** tied to the physical host.
* Stopping the instance will **wipe out all data** stored on them since the underlying physical host can change.
* Only **EBS volumes** persist across stop/start events.

---

### ❌ **Incorrect: The ENI (Elastic Network Interface) is detached**

* The **primary ENI (eth0)** is **not detached** when stopping the instance.
* It remains associated and attached when the instance is restarted.

---

### ❌ **Incorrect: The Elastic IP address is disassociated with the instance**

* If the Elastic IP (EIP) is associated with the **primary ENI**, it remains **persistently associated** with the ENI across stops and starts.
* However, if it's attached directly to the instance without a persistent ENI (rare case), then disassociation might happen — but typically, it stays attached.

---

### ❌ **Incorrect: There will be no changes**

* Data loss on instance store and possible host migration are **significant changes**.
* This statement is **not true** for instances with **instance store volumes**.

---

### ✅ Summary – Correct answers:

1. **The underlying host for the instance is possibly changed** ✅
2. **All data on the attached instance-store devices will be lost** ✅

These two directly result from how **stop/start operations work with instance store volumes and EC2 infrastructure**.
---
The correct answer is:

> ✅ **Launch an IAM Group for each department. Create an IAM Policy that enforces MFA authentication with the least privilege permission. Attach the IAM Policy to each IAM Group.**

---

### 📌 Let's break down **why this is the most secure and correct option**:

#### ✅ **IAM Groups and Policies with MFA Enforcement**

* Creating **IAM Groups per department** allows you to **logically organize** and **manage permissions** for users easily as the company grows.
* By applying an **IAM policy that includes MFA conditions** (e.g., `"Condition": {"BoolIfExists": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"}}`), you ensure that:

  * **Permissions are denied unless MFA is used.**
* This is both **scalable** and **secure** since the MFA check is enforced **directly in the policies** applied to the groups.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are incorrect:

#### ❌ **Create an IAM Role... Attach it to IAM Groups**

* IAM roles are **not directly attached to users or groups**.
* Users must **assume roles**, which adds complexity for read-only access.
* Also, **roles can't be attached to groups**, so this is structurally incorrect.

#### ❌ **Create a Service Control Policy (SCP)... attach to IAM Users**

* **SCPs** are only applicable in **AWS Organizations**, and **not attachable to IAM users**.
* SCPs work at the **account or organizational unit (OU) level**, not at the individual user level in a standalone AWS account.

#### ❌ **Set up IAM roles and associate a permissions boundary**

* **Permissions boundaries** define the **maximum permissions**, but they don't actively enforce MFA.
* You’d still need policies inside roles or users to check MFA presence.
* This option is **more complex and less straightforward** for regular user access management.

---

### ✅ Summary – Most Secure and Scalable Option:

> Create IAM Groups per department → Attach IAM Policies that:

* Grant **read-only** permissions
* **Deny actions if MFA is not enabled**

This solution is:

* **Secure** (enforces MFA)
* **Scalable** (easy to manage many users)
* **Least privilege** (only grants what is needed)

---
The correct answer is:

> ✅ **Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate to a new Aurora Serverless database.**

---

### 📌 **Why this is the correct answer:**

Amazon Aurora **Serverless v1/v2** and **provisioned clusters** use **different configurations** and **can't simply switch instance classes** (like changing from `db.t4g.medium` to Serverless) on the fly. Therefore, **you can't convert an existing provisioned Aurora cluster directly to Serverless**.

---

### ✅ **Using AWS DMS is the right approach because:**

1. **Minimal Downtime**

   * AWS DMS allows **live migration** with minimal downtime by replicating ongoing changes while the source DB is still in use.

2. **Seamless Cutover**

   * Once fully synced, you can cut over traffic to the new Aurora Serverless DB with only a short switchover period.

3. **No impact on production**

   * DMS works without affecting the performance of the existing provisioned Aurora DB cluster during migration.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are incorrect:

#### ❌ *Change the Aurora Instance class to Serverless*

* **Not possible**: You cannot change an **existing provisioned Aurora DB instance** to **Serverless** directly. They are created differently.

#### ❌ *Add an Aurora Replica with Serverless and promote it*

* **Invalid**: You **can't create a Serverless Aurora Replica** for a provisioned Aurora primary. Aurora Serverless can’t act as a read replica for provisioned clusters.

#### ❌ *Take a snapshot and restore to create a new Aurora Serverless cluster*

* While technically possible, this:

  * **Requires downtime** during snapshot creation and restore.
  * Doesn't support **ongoing change replication**, unlike AWS DMS.
  * Makes **cutover riskier** and more disruptive.

---

### ✅ Best Practice Summary:

* Use **AWS DMS** to **migrate** to a new **Aurora Serverless** cluster.
* Enable **ongoing replication**.
* Once the new DB is in sync, perform a **controlled cutover**.

Thanks for providing the **EC2 instance lifecycle states** — this clears up the billing-related questions nicely. Let’s summarize and directly map these states to **billing behavior** to avoid confusion:

---

### ✅ **EC2 Billing by Lifecycle State**

| **State**              | **Billing Applies?**                                   | **Explanation**                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`              | ❌ **No**                                               | Not billed yet; the instance is preparing to start.                                                       |
| `running`              | ✅ **Yes**                                              | Billed per second (after the first full minute).                                                          |
| `stopping` (hibernate) | ✅ **Yes**                                              | You are billed for RAM and storage during hibernation setup.                                              |
| `stopping` (normal)    | ❌ **No**                                               | You are not billed while stopping (unless hibernating).                                                   |
| `stopped`              | ❌ **No** (for On-Demand) <br> ✅ **Yes** (for Reserved) | Not billed for instance usage, but billed for **EBS**. Reserved Instances are billed regardless of state. |
| `shutting-down`        | ❌ **No**                                               | Instance is winding down; billing stops after `running` ends.                                             |
| `terminated`           | ❌ **No**                                               | Instance is deleted. However, **Reserved Instance** billing continues for its full term.                  |

---

### 🔁 Clarifying Common Misconceptions:

* **Reserved Instances**:

  * **Time-based commitment**. You're billed **even if the instance is stopped or terminated**.

* **On-Demand Instances**:

  * **Billed only while running or hibernating**.
  * Not billed in `stopped`, `pending`, or `shutting-down`.

* **Hibernate**:

  * Involves **saving memory state to EBS**.
  * Billed for **EBS and RAM** storage even when not running.

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Demand**         | Billed only in **running** or **hibernating** states.             |
| **Reserved Instance** | Billed **regardless of state** (running, stopped, or terminated). |
| **Spot Instance**     | **Not billed** if interrupted by AWS; billed while running.       |

The **correct answer** is:

> ✅ **Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.**

---

### ✅ Why this is the best choice:

This solution offers the **least operational overhead** and is **cost-effective** for connecting **multiple AWS accounts/VPCs** to your on-premises network using a single Direct Connect (DX) connection.

#### Here’s why:

* **AWS Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)** allows you to share a **single DX connection** across multiple AWS accounts and VPCs, even in different regions.
* **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** acts as a **hub** to interconnect VPCs and route traffic between them and to the DXGW.
* **Centralized network management** through the TGW significantly reduces complexity.
* **Scales easily** when new AWS accounts/VPCs are added — no need to provision new DX connections or VPNs.

---

### ❌ Why the other options are not ideal:

1. **Set up a new DX gateway + VPC peering**

   * ❌ VPC peering is **not scalable** for many accounts (it’s point-to-point).
   * ❌ No centralized routing, making management complex.

2. **AWS VPN CloudHub**

   * ❌ VPNs are **less reliable** and **slower** than Direct Connect.
   * ❌ This introduces additional management overhead.
   * ❌ Not cost-effective at scale.

3. **Another DX connection per AWS account**

   * ❌ Expensive and operationally heavy.
   * ❌ Unnecessary when a DX Gateway + TGW can achieve the same with a single DX.

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip:

**DXGW + TGW** is a **best-practice AWS networking pattern** for organizations that use a **hub-and-spoke model**, especially with multiple accounts (like in an AWS Organization with Control Tower or Landing Zone setup).

The correct answers are:

✅ **Terminate the Reserved instances as soon as possible to avoid getting billed at the on-demand price when it expires.**
✅ **Go to the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace and sell the Reserved instances.**

---

### 🧠 Here's why:

#### 1. ✅ **Terminate the Reserved Instances**

* **Stopping** a Reserved Instance (RI) **does not stop billing** — you're billed for the full term whether the instance is running or not.
* But **terminating** the instance:

  * **Frees up compute resources**
  * Ensures you don’t accidentally run On-Demand instances once the reservation expires (which would cost more)

> 🔸 Important: **You're still billed for the RI term even after terminating the instance**, but it prevents future accidental use.

---

#### 2. ✅ **Sell unused RIs in the Reserved Instance Marketplace**

* You can **sell Standard Reserved Instances** (not Convertible RIs) in the [Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html).
* This is a **cost recovery strategy** if the web application has been decommissioned early and you no longer need the capacity.

> 🔸 Note: The buyer must be in the same AWS region, and you must have at least one month left on the RI.

---

### ❌ Incorrect Choices:

#### ❌ **Stop the Reserved Instances**

* **Misleading**: You’ll **still be charged** for the RI term whether the instance is running, stopped, or terminated.

#### ❌ **Sell RIs on Amazon.com**

* Not a valid option — AWS RIs can **only be sold via the Reserved Instance Marketplace**.

#### ❌ **Cancel your AWS subscription**

* Not feasible or practical in enterprise environments and would **not stop RI charges** immediately either.

You're referring to **network ACL (Access Control List) rules** in AWS.

Here's a quick summary of how **AWS network ACL rule evaluation** works:

---

### ✅ **Key Behavior:**

* **Rules are evaluated in ascending order**, starting from the **lowest numbered rule**.
* As soon as a rule **matches** the traffic (either ALLOW or DENY), **it is applied immediately**.
* **No further rules are evaluated after a match is found**, even if higher-numbered rules contradict it.
* Network ACLs are **stateless**, so you need to define both **inbound and outbound rules** explicitly.

---

### 🔁 Example:

| Rule # | Type | Protocol | Port | Source         | Action |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| 100    | HTTP | TCP      | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0      | DENY   |
| 200    | HTTP | TCP      | 80   | 203.0.113.0/24 | ALLOW  |

* Even though rule 200 allows HTTP traffic from `203.0.113.0/24`, **rule 100 DENIES all HTTP traffic**, so **traffic is denied** — **rule 100 is matched first.**

---

### 🛑 Important Tips:

* Always **order rules carefully**.
* Use **lower numbers for more specific rules** and reserve higher numbers for broader allow/deny.
* **Default rule** (e.g., rule *\**) is the **last evaluated**, usually to DENY all traffic.

The correct answer is:

✅ **Create a new launch template.**

---

### ✅ Explanation:

To use a **new Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** in your Auto Scaling Group (ASG), you must **update the launch configuration or launch template** associated with the ASG. Since **launch configurations are immutable**, the modern and recommended approach is to use **launch templates**, which **support versioning** and **more flexible configurations**.

---

### 🔁 Why not the other options?

* ❌ **"Do nothing..."**
  Incorrect — the ASG won't automatically use a new AMI unless you update the launch configuration or launch template.

* ❌ **"Create a new target group and launch template"**
  Unnecessary — a new target group is only needed if you're changing load balancer behavior, not when updating the AMI.

* ❌ **"Create a new target group"**
  Not relevant to the AMI change.

---

### 🛠 Recommended Steps:

1. **Create a new version of the launch template** with the new AMI.
2. **Update your Auto Scaling group** to use the new launch template (or specific version).
3. Optionally, **start an instance refresh** to replace existing instances with ones based on the new AMI.
