### 🧠 **1. Generative AI**

**Definition:**
Generative AI refers to models that can create new content—text, code, images, audio, or video—based on training data. These models *generate* rather than *decide*.

**Examples:**

* GPT (ChatGPT, Claude), DALL·E, Midjourney, Copilot

**Real-time Use Cases:**

* **Content creation:** Writing blogs, reports, product descriptions
* **Code generation:** Auto-completing or generating entire code functions
* **Image generation:** Creating ad visuals or UI mockups
* **Data synthesis:** Generating sample datasets for testing

**When to Use:**

* You need content, ideas, designs, or code quickly
* Tasks are one-shot and don’t require decision-making over time
* Output is based on instructions rather than goal-based actions

### 🤖 **2. AI Agents**

**Definition:**
AI Agents are systems that *perceive* their environment, *reason* about what to do, and *act* to achieve specific goals. They are task-driven and often autonomous.

**Examples:**

* Customer support bots
* Trading bots
* Automated testing tools
* RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots

**Real-time Use Cases:**

* **Help desk automation:** Chatbots answering customer queries
* **Task execution:** Automating repetitive workflows (e.g., processing invoices)
* **Monitoring systems:** Triggering alerts/actions based on sensor or log data

**When to Use:**

* You have a specific task or process needing consistent, automated execution
* The system must react to inputs and maintain a state or context
* Decisions involve simple rules or logic

### 🧠🛠️ **3. Agentic AI (Autonomous Agents / Goal-Oriented Agents)**

**Definition:**
Agentic AI combines reasoning, memory, planning, and tool use to autonomously break down high-level goals into sub-tasks, execute them, and adapt based on feedback. It’s often built *on top* of generative AI.

**Examples:**

* Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, Microsoft's AutoGen, Devin (Cognition)

**Real-time Use Cases:**

* **Complex workflows:** Automatically plan and complete a multi-step research report
* **Data pipeline orchestration:** Instructed to “clean and analyze sales data,” and it figures out the steps
* **DevOps:** Troubleshooting and fixing infrastructure issues autonomously
* **Personal assistant agents:** Booking travel, managing calendar, sending follow-ups

**When to Use:**

* Tasks require **autonomy**, **multi-step planning**, and **self-correction**
* Human-in-the-loop supervision is minimal or periodic
* You want to delegate *"go do this goal"* rather than *"do this step"*
